<p align="justify">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tree is an important data structure in Computer
Science. Of all trees we work with, Binary Tree is probably the most popular
one. A Binary Tree is called a <b>Strictly Binary Tree</b> if every nonleaf
node in a binary tree has nonempty left and right subtrees. Let us define <b>a
Strictly Binary Tree of depth d</b>, as a Strictly Binary Tree that has at
least one root to leaf path of length <b>d</b>, and no root to leaf path in
that tree is longer than <b>d</b>. So let us use a similar reasoning to
define a generalized structure. <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An n-ary Tree is called a <b>Strictly n-ary Tree</b>
if every nonleaf node in an n-ary tree has n children each. A <b>Strictly
n-ary Tree of depth d</b> can now be defined as a Strictly n-ary Tree that
has at least one root to leaf path of length d, and no root to leaf path in
that tree is longer than d. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the value of n and depth d, your task is to
find the number of different strictly n-ary trees of depth d. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The figure below shows the 3 different strictly
binary trees of depth 2.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify'>
Input consists
of several test cases. Each test case consists of two integers <b>n (0 < n
<= 32), d (0 <= d <= 16)</b>. Input is terminated a test case where
n=0 and d=0, you must not process this test case.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">For each test
case, print three integers, n, d and the number of different strictly n-ary
trees of level d, in a single line. There will be a single space in between two
integers of a line. You can assume that you would not be asked about cases
where you had to consider trees that may have more than 2<sup>10</sup> nodes in
a level of the tree. You may also find it useful to know that the answer for
each test case will always fit in a 200 digit integer.</p>
