<p>A small group of archaeologists is working in the Antarctic. Their sensors have detected a number of caves in which there are interesting fossils. However, a thick layer of ice blocks the entrance to each cave. The archaeologists possess the equipment needed to burn a tunnel in the layer of ice, but the fuel is extremely expensive. In order to determine the size of each fossil the group has launched a number of probes through small bore-holes. Each probe which hit the fossil emits a signal consisting of its x and y coordinates. Your task is to determine the smallest possible size of the tunnel, which is equal to the maximal distance between any two probes (so that the fossil won&#8217;t be damaged during extraction). The drilling equipment needs to be provided with the squared value of this distance.

<p>Given the list of coordinates of the points containing probes, find the square of the maximal distance between any two probes.
