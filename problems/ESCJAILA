<p align="justify">
<p>A new International Common Prison for Criminals (ICPC) was built, and your old friend<br />Harry was moved there as a prisoner. As before, the new ICPC is one of the most secure<br />prisons in the world. It was designed by and old gamer and as such, the prison is not<br />necessarily closed, but only an incredibly logical and fast mind can get out.<br />The new ICPC can be represented as a grid of square cells. Each cell is empty, or it<br />contains a wall, a door, an opening button or a closing button. Harry was accommodated<br />in an empty cell, and all doors were closed. Nevertheless, Harry told you that he will<br />try to escape. Each time Harry is in a cell, he can move in a single step to an adjacent<br />cell (i.e., a cell that shares a side with his current location). Each time Harry steps on a<br />cell that contains an opening button, all doors open, while each time he steps on a cell<br />that contains a closing button, all doors close. Harry can walk around as he wants within<br />the prison, although he cannot move to a cell that contains a wall, neither to a cell that<br />contains a door if the doors are closed.<br />To escape from the prison, Harry needs to step outside, which means placing himself in<br />one of the cells on the sides and then taking one extra step out in the direction opposite<br />to the prison.<br />You obtained a map of the prison, and Harry deserves your advise. Tell him the minimum<br />number of steps he needs to escape, or warn him that there is no way to get out.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integers N and<br />M indicating respectively the number of rows and columns of the grid that represents<br />the prison (1 &le; N, M &le; 100). Line i of the next N lines describes row i of the grid<br />using a string of exactly M characters, where character j represents cell j of that row.<br />This string only contains the following characters with the indicated meanings: &ldquo;H&rdquo; is<br />the empty cell where Harry is at the beginning; &ldquo;.&rdquo; is an empty cell where Harry is not<br />at the beginning; &ldquo;W&rdquo; is a wall; &ldquo;D&rdquo; is a door; &ldquo;O&rdquo; is an opening button; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; is closing<br />button. You may assume that within each test case there is exactly one character &ldquo;H&rdquo;.<br />The end of input is indicated with a line containing the number &minus;1 twice.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with a single integer representing the minimum<br />number of steps Harry needs to escape the prison, or the number &minus;1 if it is impossible<br />for him to do so.</p>
