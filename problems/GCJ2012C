<p>Do you ever become frustrated with television because you keep seeing the same things, recycled over and over again? Well I personally don't care about television, but I do sometimes feel that way about numbers.

<p>Let's say a pair of distinct positive integers (n, m) is recycled if you can obtain m by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without changing their order. For example, (12345, 34512) is a recycled pair since you can obtain 34512 by moving 345 from the end of 12345 to the front. Note that n and m must have the same number of digits in order to be a recycled pair. Neither n nor m can have leading zeros.

<p>Given integers A and B with the same number of digits and no leading zeros, how many distinct recycled pairs (n, m) are there with A &#8804; n < m &#8804; B?

<p>Limits<br/>
1 &#8804; T &#8804; 55<br/>
A and B have the same number of digits.<br/>
1 &#8804; A &#8804; B &#8804; 2000000.<br/>

<p>Are we sure about the output to Case #4?<br/>
Yes, we're sure about the output to Case #4.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing the integers A and B.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of recycled pairs (n, m) with A &#8804; n < m &#8804; B.
