<p>You are working at a production plant of biological weapons. You are a maintainer of a terrible virus weapon
with very high reproductive power. The virus has a tendency to build up regular hexagonal colonies. So as a
whole, the virus weapon forms a hexagonal grid, each hexagon being a colony of the virus. The grid itself is in
the regular hexagonal form with <i>N</i> colonies on each edge.
<p>The virus self-propagates at a constant speed. Self-propagation is performed simultaneously at all colonies.
When it is done, for each colony, the same number of viruses are born at every neighboring colony. Note that,
after the self-propagation, if the number of viruses in one colony is more than or equal to the limit density <i>M</i>,
then the viruses in the colony start self-attacking, and the number reduces modulo <i>M</i>.
<p>Your task is to calculate the total number of viruses after <i>L</i> periods, given the size <i>N</i> of the hexagonal grid and
the initial number of viruses in each of the colonies.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases.
<p>Each case begins with a line containing three integers <i>N</i> (1 &#8804; <i>N</i> &#8804; 6), <i>M</i> (2 &#8804; <i>M</i> &#8804; 10<sup>9</sup>), and <i>L</i> (1 &#8804; <i>L</i> &#8804; 10<sup>9</sup>).
The following 2<i>N</i> - 1 lines are the description of the initial state. Each non-negative integer (smaller than <i>M</i>)
indicates the initial number of viruses in the colony. The first line contains the number of viruses in the <i>N</i> colonies
on the topmost row from left to right, and the second line contains those of <i>N</i> + 1 colonies in the next row, and
so on.
<p>The end of the input is indicated by a line "0 0 0".

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output the test case number followed by the total number of viruses in all colonies after <i>L</i>
periods.
