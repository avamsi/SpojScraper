In Episode III of Star Wars (whose alleged title is "How I became Vader"), R2-D2 (Artoo-Detoo) is again confronted to a tedious work.
He is responsible for the loading of the republic transport starships in the fastest way. Imagine a huge space area where n starships are parked.
Each starship has a capacity of K cubic femtoparsec. Containers C<sub>i</sub> arrive one at a time with some volume v<sub>i</sub> (expressed in cubic femtoparsec).
R2-D2 wants to minimize the number of starships used for a given sequence of containers.<br>
Smart as he is, R2-D2 knows for sure that the problem is a hard one, even with the force being around.
Here is the heuristics he selected to solve his problem. Start with all starships ready to load, and numbered S<sub>0</sub>,S<sub>1</sub>,etc.
When a container C<sub>j</sub> arrives, select the starship of minimal index i that can contain C<sub>j</sub> and put it in S<sub>i</sub>.
In some sense, this heuristic minimizes the move of the container arriving before its loading.<br>
At the end of the n arrivals, R2-D2 counts the number s of starships used and he measures the total waste w of the sequence.
For i=0..s-1, the waste in starship i is given by the unused volume.<br>
Your task is to simulate the algorithm of R2-D2.

<H3>Input</h3>
<P align=justify>
The first line of the input contains a number T &#8804; 10 that indicates the number of test cases to follow.
Each test case begins with K on a line (K &#8804; 1000), followed by the number of containers in the sequence, n, on the second line (1 &#8804; n &#8804; 1000000).
There are two possible formats for the remaining lines. If it contains one integer, then this is the next v<sub>i</sub>. If it begins with the character b
(for block), it is followed by 2 integers r and v. This means that the r next containers arriving have volume v.
</p>
<H3>Output</h3>
<p>
Your program must output the number s of starships used, followed by a blank, followed by the total waste w.<br>
You can assume, that at most 100000 starships are needed, and R2-D2 has to change the starships in which the next container is loaded at most 100000 times.
