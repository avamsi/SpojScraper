<p>
Farmer John has N (1 <= N <= 25,000) rectangular barns on his farm, all
with sides parallel to the X and Y axes and integer corner coordinates in
the range 0..1,000,000. These barns do not overlap although they may
share corners and/or sides with other barns.

Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of
his barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a
wall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its
walls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into
another barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.

Please determine how many barns have room to expand.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
t &#8211; the number of test cases, then t test cases follow. 
<p>
Each test case takes the following form:
<p>
The first line contains the number of rectangular barns - n.
<p>
Each of the next n lines contains:
<p>
Four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D,      describing one barn. The lower-left corner of the barn is at (A,B) and the upper right corner is at (C,D).

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case write a single integer that is the number of barns that can be expanded in a separate line 

<h3>Example</h3>

<b>Input/Output details:</b>
<p>
There are 5 barns.  The first barn has its lower-left corner at (0,2) and
its upper-right corner at (2,7), and so on.
<p>
Only two barns can be expanded --- the first two listed in the input.
All other barns are each in contact with at least one other barn.
