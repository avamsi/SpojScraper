<p>Our friend Picko is very reach and he wants to open lots of restaurants with delivery. The main food will be, of course, pizza.  He has certain number of potential locations for the restaurants,  and he knows the locations of the solitairs with lots of people which  will often be his customers.  Delivery of each restaurant will cover all the solitairs in given radius.</p>
<p>Picko can open only limited number of restaurants, and he wants that  restaurants on the locations which will cover maximal  number of people  in solitairs.</p>
<p>Write a program that will calculate maximal number of people which  we can cover with delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first line of the input file there are two integers K  and R, separated with space, number of restaurants and radius of  delivery, 1 &le; K &le; 10, 1 &le; R &le; 500.</p>
<p>In the second line there is integer M, number of locations, K &le; M &le; 20.</p>
<p>In each of the next M lines there are two integer X and Y, separated  with space, coordinates of each location, -1000 &le; X,Y &le; 1000.</p>
<p>In the next line there is integerN, number of solitairs, 1 &le; N &le; 100.</p>
<p>In each of the next N lines there are three integers X, Y and S,  separated with space, X and Y are coordinates of each solitaire, and S  is number of people in that solitaire, -1000 &le; X,Y &le; 1000, 1 &le; S &le; 100.</p>
<p>We consider that solitaire is in radius of some restaurant if  distance between them is less or equal to R.  There are no two locations of restaurants on the same place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; In only line of the output file we have to write maximal number from  the text above.</p>
