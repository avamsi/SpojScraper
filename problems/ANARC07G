<p>A favorite pastime for big families in Acmestan is going to the movies. It is quite common to see a number of these multi-generation families going together to watch a movie. Movie theaters in Acmestan have two types of tickets: A single ticket is for exactly one person while a family ticket allows a parent and their children to enter the theater.&nbsp; Needless to say, a family ticket is always priced higher than a single ticket, sometimes as high as &#64257;ve times the price of a single ticket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/a9pwqo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is quite challenging for families to decide which ticket arrangement is most economical to buy. For example, the family depicted in the &#64257;gure on the right has four ticket arrangements to choose from: Seven single tickets; Two family tickets; One family ticket (for adam, bob, cindy)plus four single tickets for the rest; Or, one family ticket (for bob and his four children) plus single tickets for the remaining two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Write a program to determine which ticket arrangement has the least price. If there are more than one such arrangement, print the arrangement that has the least number of tickets.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Input</h1>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. The &#64257;rst line of each test case includes two positive integers (S and F)where S is the price of a single ticket and F is the price of a family ticket. The remaining lines of the test case are either the name of a person going by him/herself, or of the form:</p>
<pre>N1 N2 N3 ... Nk<br /><br /></pre>
<p>where N1 is the name of a parent, with N2 ... Nk being his/her children. Names are all lower-case letters, and no longer than 1000 characters. No parent will be taking more than 1000 of their children to the movies :-). Names are unique, the name of a particular person will appear at most twice: Once as a parent, and once as a child. There will be at least one person and at most 100,000 people in any test case.</p>
<p>The end of a test case is identi&#64257;ed by the beginning of the following test case (a line made of twointegers.) The end of the last test case is identi&#64257;ed by two zeros.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Output</h1>
<p>For each test case, write the result using the following format:</p>
<pre>k. NS NF T</pre>
<p>Where k is the test case number (starting at 1,) NS is the number of single tickets, NF is the number of family tickets, and T is the total cost of tickets.</p>
