The city of <B>Y-O</B> is a network of two-way streets and junctions with the following properties:

<ol>
<li> There is no more than one street between each pair of junctions.
<li> Every junction is connected to every other junction either directly via a street or through other junctions by a unique path.
<li> When a light is placed at a junction, all the streets meeting at this junction are also lit.
</ol>
</p>

<p align="left">
A valid lighting is a set of  junctions such that if lights were placed at these, all the streets would be lit.
An optimal lighting is a valid lighting such that it contains the least number of junctions.
</p>

<p align="left">
The task is divided into two subtasks:
<ol>
<li> Find the number of lights in an optimal lighting.
<li> Find the total number of such optimal lightings in the city.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<ul>
<li> The first line of the input contains a positive integer <B>t <= 20</B>, denoting the number of test cases.
<li> The description of the test cases follows one after the other.


<li><B>Network Description:</B>
<ul> 
<li> The first line of description of a network consists of a positive integer <B>n <= 100010</B> denoting the number of junctions in the network. 
<li> Each junction is numbered with a unique integer between <B>1</B> and <B>n</B>.
<li> The following <B>n-1</B> lines contain a pair of integers <B>u v (1 <= u,v  <=  n)</B> separated by a single space denoting that there is a street between junction <B>u</B> and junction <B>v</B>.
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p align="left">
The output must consist of <B>t</B> lines, the <B>k<sup>th</sup></B> line corresponding to the <B>k<sup>th</sup></B> network; <B>(1 <= k <= t)</B>.
The <B>k<sup>th</sup></B> line must contain two integers separated by a single space.
The first integer on the <B>k<sup>th</sup></B> line must be the number of junctions in an optimal lighting of network <B>k</B>.
The second integer must be <B>N%10007</B>, which is the remainder left by the number of optimal lightings when divided by <B>10007</B>.
