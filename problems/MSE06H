Japan plans to welcome the ACM ICPC World Finals and a lot of roads 
must be built for the venue. Japan is tall island with N cities on the 
East coast and M cities on the West  coast  (M  &#8804;  1000, N  &#8804;  1000).  
K  superhighways  will  be  build. Cities  on  each 
coast are numbered 1, 2, ... from North to South. Each superhighway is 
straight line and connects city on  the East coast with city of  the 
West coast. </p><p>
The  funding  for  the construction is guaranteed by ACM. A major portion 
of the sum is determined by the number of  crossings between  superhighways. 
At most  two  superhighways  cross at one  location. Write a program  
that calculates  the number of  the crossings between 
superhighways. 
<p> 
The input file starts with T - the number of test cases. Each test case 
starts with three numbers &#8211; N, M, K. Each of the next K lines contains 
two numbers &#8211; the numbers of cities connected by  the superhighway. 
The first one  is  the number of  the city on  the 
East coast and second one is the number of the city of the West coast. 
</p> <p>
For each test case write one line on the standard output: 
</p> <p>Test case "case number": "number of crossings" </p>
