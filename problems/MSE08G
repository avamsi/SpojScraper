John has recently arrived in Bucharest for the South Eastern 
European Regional Contest. John is famous for his theory of lucky 
numbers. That&#8217;s why all the contestants and spectators are very happy. 
According to that theory  4 and  7 are lucky digits, and all the 
other digits are not lucky. A lucky number is a number that contains 
only lucky digits in decimal notation. A very lucky number is a number 
that can be expressed as a product of several lucky numbers. A lucky 
number by itself is considered to be very lucky. For  example, numbers 
47, 49, 112 are very lucky. </p><p>
Your task is to calculate the number of very lucky numbers that are 
not less than A and not greater than B. Of course, numbers A and B are 
given by John. </p><p>
 
 
<h3>Input</h3>
</p><p>
The first line of the input contains a single integer T &#8211; a number 
of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers separated 
by a single space &#8211; A and B. 
</p><p>
<h3>Output</h3>
</p><p>
Output must contain T lines &#8211; answers for the test cases. 
Constrains: </p><p>
1 &#8804; T &#8804; 7777, </p><p>
1 &#8804; A &#8804; B &#8804; 1000000000000 (10^12).  </p><p>
