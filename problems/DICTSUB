<p align="justify">
<p>You have a dictionary of strings, and you want to perform some queries on the strings.  In particular, you're given a single string T, and for each word W in the dictionary, you want to determine if W is a subsequence of T.
A string B is a subsequence of a string C if you can remove zero or more of C's letters to form a string equal to B (but the order of remaining letters may not be rearranged).
<br><br>
Each word W in the dictionary will be described in the input as a run length encoded (RLE) string.  That is, W will be described by several pairs of data values, where each pair of data values consists of a positive integer K
with no leading zeros and a letter L.  A data pair with values K and L represents a string with K occurrences of the character L.  To get the uncompressed string, we concatenate all strings represented by the data pairs.
For example, the RLE string 2A1B5C12A represents the string AABCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAAA.


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0&lt;C&lt;10), the number of test cases to follow.  Each case begins with a line containing a positive integer D (0&lt;D&lt;10000) representing the number of dictionary words and a string T
with length between 1 and 10000.  D lines follow, with each line containing a string with length between 1 and 200 in RLE format, which represents a dictionary word with uncompressed length between 1 and 10000. All uncompressed strings
(T and dictionary words) will consist only of uppercase letters ('A'-'Z').

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output for each case consists of several lines.  There should be one line per dictionary word W (in the order of appearance in input) that will say either "YES" if W is a subsequence of T, or "NO" otherwise.  Print a blank line after each test case.
