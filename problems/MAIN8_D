<p>One day Rohil was getting very bored so he was tossing an unbiased coin randomly. He observed that certain patterns (a sequence of Head and Tail) appear very frequently&nbsp;while some other are very rare. Being a programmer he decided to code a solution which takes a pattern string as input and tells what is&nbsp;the expected number of times he will have to toss his coin to see that pattern. He wrote this program very quickly. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<p>First line contains ( 1&lt;=T&lt;=25 ) the number of test cases. Each of following T lines contains a pattern string of 'H' and 'T' only. H is for Head and T is for Tail.</p>
<p>|S| &lt;= 40</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print the output in a new line (it is guaranteed that answer will always be an integer and fits in 64 bit type).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
