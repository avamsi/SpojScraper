<p align="justify">
<p>My kid's kindergarten class is putting up a Christmas play.&nbsp; (I hope he gets the lead role.)&nbsp; The kids are all excited, but the teacher has a lot of work.&nbsp; She has to produce costumes for a scene with K soldiers.&nbsp; She wants to buy all the costumes in the same size, allowing for some small amount of length alteration to be done by the kids' parents later.&nbsp; So she has taken all the kids' height measurements.&nbsp; Can you help her select K kids from her class of N to play the soldier role, such that the height difference between the tallest and shortest in the group is minimized, and alternations will be easiest?&nbsp; Tell her what this minimum difference is. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>INPUT</strong> <br />The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow each containing 2 lines. <br />&nbsp;<br />The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N and K. <br />The second line contains N integers denoting the height of the N kids. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>OUTPUT</strong> <br />Output T lines, each line containing the required answer for the corresponding test case. <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>CONSTTRAINTS</strong> <br />T &lt;= 30 <br />1 &lt;= K &lt;= N &lt;= 20000 <br />1 &lt;= height &lt;= 1000000000 <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>SAMPLE INPUT</strong><br />3 <br />3 1 <br />2 5 4 &nbsp;<br />3 2 <br />5 2 4 &nbsp;<br />3 3 <br />2 5 4 &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>SAMPLE OUTPUT</strong> <br />0 <br />1 <br />3 <br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>EXPLANATION</strong><br />In the first test case, the teacher needs to only select 1 kid and hence she can choose any kid since the height difference is going to be 0. <br />In the second test case, the teacher can choose kids with height 4 and 5. <br />In the third test case, the teacher is forced to choose all 3 kids and hence the answer = 5-2 = 3</p>
