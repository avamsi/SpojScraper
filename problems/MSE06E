The payment system  in  the University of Mineral Water Production  is
completely automated (written entirely in Tomato Programming Language)
and lets you input the amount of money you want  to withdraw. Due  
to  the high payment  rates of  the professors  they may  input  the
amounts in exponential forms. So if you want to withdraw 16 MWU (mineral 
water units) you can enter 16, 2^4 or 2^2^2. </p><p>
One day, Stanescu  tried  to withdraw  some money  from his account 
which had balance of 80MWU. He mistakenly entered 2^3^2 and  for his
surprise he got 512MWU, although he should not be able to take more than 80. </p><p>
The system was composed of two main modules &#8211; the  first module checks 
whether  the account has enough money  to execute  the  transaction
and the second module gives the money to the user. It turned out 
that the first module has a problem with  the  '^'  operator.  It  
evaluates  it  from  left  to  right, while  the  second  evaluates
them from right to left (the correct way). Thus for the first module 
2^3^2=(2^3)^2=64 while for the second it&#8217;s 2^3^2=2^(3^2)=512. </p><p>
You have to write program which helps Stanescu get as much as he can
from the university system.  If you  think  it&#8217;s not  legal or something, 
be sure  that  the University of Mineral Water
Production is bad and evil. </p><p>
In the input file the amounts of the accounts of Stanescu will be given. 
Each amount is given on a separate line and is an integer between 2 and 10^100-1. </p><p>
For  each  given  amount,  your  program  should  print  to  the  
standard  output what  Stanescu should enter to get maximal number
of money. The output should: </p><p>
&#8226;  consists only of integers and the '^' operator between them.  </p><p>
&#8226;  pass the check of the first module and be as much as possible for 
the second. </p><p>
&#8226;  not contain the number 1 (it is useless anyway).  </p><p>
If more  than one answers exist, output  the one whose  first number  
is minimal,  if still more exist, choose the one whose second number 
is minimal and so on. </p><p>
