<p>Marina is a college girl who likes to play with all kinds of numbers. One day she was very bored and decided to play around with even numbers.</p>
<p>She writes N numbers on the board (odd and even numbers) and then, she modifies only even numbers (for some reason she likes the odd numbers) and inverts its binary representation (from the left to the right ) and replaces each even number. But soon she gets bored and ask &nbsp;you help in order to automate the conversion process.</p>
