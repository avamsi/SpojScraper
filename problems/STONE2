<p>Mr. B loves to play with colorful stones. There are n colors of stones in his collection. Two stones with the same color are indistinguishable. Mr. B would like to select some stones and arrange them in line to form a beautiful pattern. After several arrangements he finds that it's very hard for him to enumerate all the patterns. So he asks you to write a program to count the number of different patterns.</p>
<p>Two patterns are considered different, if and only if they have different number of stones or have different colors on at least one position.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n indicating the kinds of stones Mr. B have. Following this is a line containing n integers - the number of available stones of each color respectively. All the input numbers will be nonnegative and no more than 100.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the number of different patterns Mr. B can make with these stones, modulo 1,000,000,007, which is a prime number.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3
1 1 1
2
1 2

<strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1: 15
Case 2: 8
</pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>In the first case, suppose the colors of the stones Mr. B has are B, G and M, the different patterns Mr. B can form are: B; G; M; BG; BM; GM; GB; MB; MG; BGM; BMG; GBM; GMB; MBG; MGB.</p>
