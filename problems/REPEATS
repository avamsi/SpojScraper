<p>
A string s is called an (k,l)-repeat if s is obtained by concatenating k>=1 times some seed string t with length l>=1. For example, the string 
<p>
s = abaabaabaaba
<p>
is a (4,3)-repeat with t = aba as its seed string. That is, the seed string t is 3 characters long, and the whole string s is obtained by repeating t 4 times. <p>
Write a program for the following task: Your program is given a long string u consisting of characters &#8216;a&#8217; and/or &#8216;b&#8217; as input. Your program must find some (k,l)-repeat that occurs as substring within u with k as large as possible. For example, the input string
<p>
u = babb<u>abaabaabaaba</u>b
<p>
contains the underlined (4,3)-repeat s starting at position 5. Since u contains no other contiguous substring with more than 4 repeats, your program must output the maximum k. 
<p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
In the first line of the input contains H- the number of test cases (H <= 20). H test cases follow. First line of each test cases is n - length of the input string (n <= 50000), The next n lines contain the input string, one character (either &#8216;a&#8217; or &#8216;b&#8217;) per line, in order. 
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test cases, you should write exactly one interger k in a line - the repeat count that is maximized. 
<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>

since a (4, 3)-repeat is found starting at the 5th character of the input string.
