While visiting a traveling fun fair you
suddenly have an urge to break the high
score in the Whac-a-Mole game. The goal
of the Whac-a-Mole game is to... well...
whack moles. With a hammer. To make
the job easier you have &#64257;rst consulted
the fortune teller and now you know the
exact appearance patterns of the moles.
    The moles appear out of holes occupying the n<sup>2</sup> integer points (x, y) 
satisfying 0 &#8804; x, y &lt;n in a 
two-dimensional coordinate system. 
At each time step, some moles will 
appear and then disappear again before 
the next time step. After the moles appear 
but before they disappear, you are able
 to move your hammer in a straight line 
to any position (x2 , y2 ) that is at ditance 
at most d from your current position (x1 , y1 ). For simplicity, we assume that yo
can only move your hammer to a point having integer coordinates. A mole is whacke
if the center of the hole it appears out of is located on the line between (x1 , y1 ) an
(x2 , y2 ) (including the two endpoints). Every mole whacked earns you a point. Whe
the game starts, before the &#64257;rst time step, you are able to place your hammer anywher
you see &#64257;t.



<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing three
integers n, d and m, where n and d are as described above, and m is the total number
of moles that will appear 
(1 &#8804; n &#8804; 20, 1 &#8804; d &#8804; 5, and 1 &#8804; m &#8804; 1000). Then follow
m lines, each containing three integers x, y and t giving the position and time of the
appearance of a mole (0 &#8804; x, y < n and 1 &#8804; t &#8804; 10). No two moles will appear at the
same place at the same time.
    The input is ended with a test case where n = d = m = 0. This case should not be
processed.


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing a single integer, the maximum
possible score achievable.
