<p>A macro processor is a symbol processing program. It takes a stream of characters as its input, and
produces a stream of characters as its output. A &#8220;macro&#8221; is similar to ordinary function in that it has a
definition, and when invoked, that definition is applied to the argument(s) to yield the result. In this
problem, you will develop a simple macro processor.

<p><p>
A &#8220;macro call&#8221; consists of a name and a list of arguments, separated by commas. The name is preceded by
'[' (a left bracket) and the last argument is followed by ']' (a right bracket). For example, &#8220;[doit,to,it]&#8221;
calls the macro named &#8220;doit&#8221; with two arguments, &#8220;to&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221;. &#8220;[random]&#8221; calls the macro named &#8220;random&#8221;
with no arguments.

<p><p>
Before a macro can be called, it must be defined by associating its name with a symbol string. This
definition string may contain the special constructions &#8220;$1&#8221; through &#8220;$9&#8221; to reference the first through
the ninth macro parameters. &#8220;$0&#8221; references the macro&#8217;s name itself. When the macro is called, these
constructions are literally replaced by the values of the parameters. For example, suppose the definition
string for the macro named &#8220;321&#8221; was &#8220;$3-$2-$1&#8221;. The macro call &#8220;[321,This,is,fun]&#8221; would yield the output
&#8220;fun-is-This&#8221;. A macro call can appear anywhere. For example, the macro call &#8220;[321,[321,A,B,C],D,E]&#8221; would
yield the output &#8220;E-D-C-B-A&#8221;.

<p><p>
Input enclosed in '<' and '>' prevents the evaluation of the text enclosed, allowing special characters like
'[', ']', ',' and '$' to be used in other than their usual contexts. Thus the macro call &#8220;[321,<$>,<[>,<,>]&#8221; would
yield &#8220;,-[-$&#8221;.

<p><p>
Macros are defined using the predefined macro named &#8220;def&#8221;, which has two arguments. The first argument
is the name of the macro being defined, and the second argument is the defining symbol string for the
macro. The &#8220;321&#8221; macro definition is &#8220;[def,321,<$3-$2-$1>]&#8221;. Note that the definition is enclosed in '<' and
'>' to prevent &#8220;$1&#8221;, &#8220;$2&#8221;, and &#8220;$3&#8221; from being interpreted as parameter references to def. The def macro
produces no output. Naturally, the def macro isn&#8217;t defined using def, but is treated specially by the
implementation.

<p><p><p>
<b>Processing</b><p>
The input stream is processed character by character and copied to the output until a macro call is
encountered, or the input is exhausted (which terminates processing). A macro call is evaluated as
described below, with the result (if any) copied to the output.

<p><p>
<ol>
<li>The macro name and the parameters are evaluated in sequence from left to right. This may require
evaluating additional macro calls, which must be processed recursively.
<li>When the argument list is complete (that is, when the closing ']' is encountered) the definition of
the macro being called is scanned in the same manner as the original input stream except that
occurrences of &#8220;$0&#8221;, &#8220;$1&#8221;, and so forth are replaced literally by the corresponding arguments. The
result of the macro call is the symbol stream produced by this scan.
<li>When the macro call is completed, the macro name and the arguments are discarded, and processing
resumes at the point where it was interrupted by the macro call.
</ol>
<p><p>
<b>Limits and Caveats</b><p>
Macro names and arguments will contain no more than 32 characters each. The defining string for a macro
will contain no more than 100 characters. Macros will never be defined more than once (that is, the same
macro name will not be used more than once as the first argument to &#8220;def&#8221;). Macro calls will always provide
the correct number of arguments. Character case is significant in comparisons. All input characters,
including end of line characters, are to be processed through the macro processor. No output line will
contain more than 80 characters, including the end of line character. The input is guaranteed to be correct.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There will be multiple cases to consider. The input for each case begins with a line containing a single
integer between 1 and 10, that specifies the number of lines of text immediately following that will be used
as input to the macro processor. None of these lines will contain more than 80 characters, so the input to
the macro processor will contain at most 810 characters. The last case will be followed by a line containing
the integer 0.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each input case, display the case number (1, 2, &#8230;), a line containing 79 hyphens, the output from the
macro processor, another line containing 79 hyphens, and a blank line.

<p><p>
In the sample input shown below, assume that the last visible character on each line is immediately followed
by the end of line character. Blank lines in the expected output are shown here as **BLANK** for clarity,
but these should actually be totally blank in your output.
