<p>When trying to clean your old room, you find out your old notes from high school.<br />Reading the homeworks you were given then, you start thinking how much easier they<br />would have been today. However, there is a particular one that still seems to maintain<br />its difficulty.</p>
<p>When the solution to a problem involved solving the square root of an integer, to keep<br />a fancy and clean expression, you were asked to express it as the integer part and the<br />root part. This means that if you had as solution N you were asked to express it<br />as &radic;N = A &radic;B with the part A being as high as possible. For instance, 180 can be<br />expressed as 1 &radic;180, 2 &radic;45, 3 &radic;20 or 6 &radic;5. Of course, the last expression is the correct<br />one.</p>
<p>Now that you are grown up, you decide to write a program to perform this task for you.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line contains<br />an integer N (1 &le; N &le; 10<sup>18</sup> ). The last line of the input contains a single &minus;1 and should<br />not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with two integers A and B separated by a single<br />space such that &radic;N = A &radic;B and A is maximum.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />180<br />17<br />1000000000000000000<br />-1<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong>
6 5<br />1 17<br />1000000000 1</pre>
