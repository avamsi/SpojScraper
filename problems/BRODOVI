<p>Mirko lives in a small town with a harbour: once in a blue moon a ship passes by. However, to this day<br />Mirko remembers the day when all the ships who had ever visited the harbour showed up. He<br />denoted this day by index 1.<br />Many days have passed since, but Mirko noted each day when at least one ship visited the harbour,<br />naming these days entertaining.<br />Additionally, Mirko has noticed that each ship visits the harbour periodically, at regular intervals. For<br />instance, an interval of length 3 implies that some ship visited the harbour on days 1, 4, 7, 10 etc.<br />Given Mirko&rsquo;s list of entertaining days (including today which is considered to be an entertaining day as<br />well), compute the minimum possible number of ships visiting his harbour.<br />Notes: All entertaining days appear on Mirko&rsquo;s list. It is guaranteed that the given data is consistent - in<br />other words, a solution will always exist.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer N (2 &le; N &le; 5000), the number of entertaining days.<br />The following N lines contain indices of entertaining days, one per line, in ascending order. The first<br />and the last indices, representing the day from which Mirko started monitoring harbour traffic and<br />today, respectively, will always appear on the list. The first index will always be 1, and the last one<br />(index of today) will be less than 109.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of ships.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />5<br />1<br />7<br />10<br />13<br />19<br /><strong>Output:</strong><br />2</pre>
