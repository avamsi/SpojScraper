In the biology laboratory we are observing several bacterial 
        samples, and under 
                the microscope we have them shaded with different colors to see them expanding 
                their territory on the plate.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that the 
        bacterial are 
                quite 'friendly' that once they meet each other, they do not expand into each 
                other's occupation any more. The bacterial samples are expanding 
        at similar speeds and we take them as the same speed.</p><p>Since the experiment is tedious and lengthy (Oh My 
                God! there are several thousand samples at our pick), we are going to run a 
                simulation based on this reality, taking the variable that these 
        samples may be planted in different starting spots.</p>
        <p>
We are using rectangular plates and 
        bacterial racing is bounded within the plate.</p>

<h3>Input format</h3>         <p>There are multiple test cases (about 20000 of them) each taking the following format:</p>
<div align=left>
<ul><li>one line with two integers between 1 
        and 1000 inclusive indicating width and height of the plate
<li>one line with one integer between 1 and 100 inclusive indicating the 
        number of bacterial samples
<li>for each bacterial sample there is one line with two integers 
        indicating the sample's position:<br>
        x y, where x, y specify a position within or on the bound of the 
        plate.
</ul></div>
        <p>The plate lies in such a coordinating system that the lower-left corner of it is (0,0) and the upper-right corner is (width,height).</p>
        <p>A test with zero plate area marks the end of 
        the tests and this one shall not be processed.</p>
        <p>Between each input block there is a 
        blank line.</p>
        <p>
<h3>Output format</h3>
<p>
Generate a report having the samples sorted on their domination, 
        with each line taking the following format:<br>
        &lt;sample id> &lt;area occupation><br>
        where: 'sample id' takes 3 columns right justified, with '0' padded to 
        the left as necessary, and 'area occupation' 
        takes 14 columns with 2 digit precision, right justified.</p>
        <p>The sample occupying more area shall be 
        reported prior to those occupying less. The input data will ensure 
        enough difference in areas to avoid ambiguity.</p>
        <p>Between each output block there shall 
        be a blank line.</p>
