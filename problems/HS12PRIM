<p align="justify">
<p>Erdős P&aacute;l and John Selfridge classified prime numbers in this way: for a prime <strong>p</strong>, if the largest prime factor of <strong>p-1</strong> is <strong>2</strong> or <strong>3</strong>, then <strong>p</strong> is in class one.  Otherwise, <strong>p</strong> is in class <strong>c+1</strong> where <strong>c</strong> is the largest of the classes of the prime factors of <strong>p-1</strong>. We put <strong>p=2</strong> in class one.  For example, <strong>p=89</strong> is in class three, because <strong>p-1=2^3*11</strong> and here <strong>2</strong> is in class one, but <strong>11</strong> is in class two (because <strong>11-1=2*5</strong> and here <strong>2</strong> and <strong>5</strong> are in class one). Your task is to count the number of primes in each class up to class thirteen for a given (closed) interval.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains the number of test cases <em>T</em>, where <em>T&le;1000</em>. Each of the following <em>T</em> lines contains two integers <strong>a,b</strong> where&nbsp;<em><strong>0&le;a&le;b&le;50000000</strong></em>. <span style="color: #000020; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify; background-color: #f6f9e0;">There are 4 input sets for 10 points.</span></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the case number, followed by the distribution of the primes in each class up to class <strong>13</strong> in the (closed) interval <em>[a,b]</em>. See the sample input/output for the correct format!</p>
