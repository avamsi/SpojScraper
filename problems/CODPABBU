<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input will have number 'T', the number of test cases. [ T &lt;= 2000 ]</p>
<p>Each of the test cases will have 2 lines -:</p>
<p>First line will have 3 space-separated numbers 'a' ,'d' &nbsp;and &nbsp; 'r' respectively.</p>
<p>2nd line will have 2 space-separated numbers 'n' &amp; 'm' respectively.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print the required answer in a separate line.</p>
<p>NOTE - The value of a , d , r , n &amp; m will be more than 0 and less than 10^8.</p>
