Like every year, Dragon War contest is going to be organized in Berk in which dragons fight till certain time limit and winning group of dragons are embraced as&nbsp; lucky dragon group for the village. Each dragon is characterized by its unique power level Pi. There are N dragons in the village with each dragon having a power level in the range [1,N]. No two dragons have the same power level. Hiccup does not want Dragons to fight so he comes up with a new strategy to select the required group of Dragons. He tells the villagers the he had a dream last night in which his father told him that a group of dragons will be lucky for the village if following two conditions are satisfied:<br />1) There are at least two dragons in the group.<br />2) Difference in the power level of any two dragons in the group is at least two.<br /><br />Hiccup is going to choose any random lucky group of dragons to avoid the Dragon War but first he wants to know how many such groups are possible.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains T i.e. number of test cases. Next T lines contains an integer N denoting number of dragons in the village followed by an integer M.</p>

<p>Print (number of lucky dragon groups possible) % M for each N</p>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<p>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100000<br />1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^18<br />1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10^18</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br />1 3<br />3 2
