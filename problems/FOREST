<p align="justify">
<p>Given a directed graph, may contains repeated edges. We assume that the graph contains and only contains K edge-disjoint branchings rooted by node 0.<br />A branching for a graph is a set of directed edges that from a certain root (root, in this problem, is node 0) we can find one path to every other node in the graph by only the edges in the branching.<br />K edge-disjoint branching is K branchings that share no common edges.<br />Your task which is easy and funny is to find out the K branchings.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer T, (T&lt;=20), denoting the number of test cases.<br />For each test case:<br />The first line contains two integers N and K, (2&lt;=N&lt;=500,2&lt;=K&lt;=6), which is the number of the nodes in the graph and the number of edge-disjoint branchings.<br />Then next (N-1)*K lines contains the information about the edges. There are 2 integers X and Y in every line, meaning there exist an edge from X to Y in the graph.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You should output the branchings you have found.<br />For every test cases, print the number of test case at the start of output, then you should output K lines.<br />Each line is about a branching which contains N-1 integers that the ID of the edges in this branching.<br />The ID of edges starts with 0. Every edge will appear and only appear once in the output.<br />See samples for further details.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br />2 2<br />0 1<br />0 1<br />3 2<br />0 1<br />0 2<br />2 1<br />1 2</pre>
<pre><strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1:<br />0<br />1<br />Case 2:<br />0 3<br />1 2</pre>
