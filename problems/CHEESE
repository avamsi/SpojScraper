<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The input will consist of one or more test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing</p>
<p>three integers N (1 &le; N &le; 200), M (1 &le; M &le; N (N &minus; 1)) and K(1 &le; K &le; 10). The cities are</p>
<p>numbered from 0 to N &minus; 1, and the capital is the city number 0. Each of the N next lines</p>
<p>contains the names of the cities, in increasing order of their numbers. Each name will contain</p>
<p>only upper and lower case English letters, and its length will not exceed 30000. Each of the</p>
<p>M next lines will describe the road network of the country. Each line will be in the form A</p>
<p>B C (0 &le; A, B &lt; N, A = B, 1 &le; C &le; 109 ) and indicates a road connecting city A to city</p>
<p>B with tra&#64259;c &#64258;ow limit C. There won&rsquo;t be more than one road connecting a pair of cities</p>
<p>in the same direction, and it will always be possible to go from the capital to any other city.</p>
<p>The last test case will be followed by a line containg three zeros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each test case, print one line with k - the number of chosen cities. Then, print k</p>
<p>lines in the format n (pp) f , where n is a city name, pp is its pronunciation power and f is</p>
<p>the maximum &#64258;ow from the capital to the city. Print the cities in increasing order of their</p>
<p>numbers. Also, if the capital is a chosen city, use f = 0. You may assume that k &le; 2K for</p>
<p>each test case.</p>
