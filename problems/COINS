<p>

In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.
<p>
Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n
can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4.
But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).

<p>
You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange
rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.

<p>
You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars
you can get for it?

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input will contain several test cases (not more than 10). Each
testcase is a single line with a number n, 0 <= n <= 1 000 000 000.
It is the number written on your coin.


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case output a single line, containing the maximum amount
of American dollars you can make.

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
12
2

<b>Output:</b>
13
2
</pre>

<p>
You can change 12 into 6, 4 and 3, and then change these into
$6+$4+$3 = $13.

If you try changing the coin 2 into 3 smaller coins, you will get
1, 0 and 0, and later you can get no more than $1 out of them.
It is better just to change the 2 coin directly into $2.
