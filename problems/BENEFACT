<p>Another chapter of the municipal chronicles of a well known  unbelievable lordly major town (if this town is not well known to you,  you might want to solve problem CSTREET first) tells us the following  story: <br /> Once upon a time the citizens of the unbelievable lordly major town  decided to elect a major. At that time this was a very new idea and  election campaigns were completely unknown. But of course several  citizens wanted to become major and it didn't took long for them to  find out, that promising nice things that never will become real tends  to be useful in such a situation. One candidate to be elected as a  major was Ivo  sometimes called the benefactor because of his valuable  gifts to the unbelievably lordly major towns citizens.<br /> One day before the election day Ivo the benefactor made a promise to the  citizens of the town. In case of his victory in the elections he would  ensure that on one of the paved streets of the town street lamps would  be erected and that he would pay that with his own money. As thrifty as  the citizens of the unbelievable lordly major town were, they elected  him and one day after the elections they presented him their decision  which street should have street lamps. Of course they chose not only  the longest of all streets but renamed several streets so that a very  long street in the town existed. <br /> Can you find how long this street was? To be more specific, the  situation is as follows. You are presented a list of all paved streets  in the unbelievable lordly major town. As you might remember from  problem CSTREET in the town the streets are paved in a way that  between every two points of interest in the town exactly one paved  connection exists. Your task is to find the longest distance that  exists between any two places of interest in the city.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of testcases t.<br /> The first line of each testcase contains the number of places (2 &lt;=n&lt;=50000) in the town. Each street is given at one line by two places (1&lt;=a,b&lt;=n) and the length of the street (0&lt;=l&lt;20000).</p>
