<p align="justify">
<p>Charly and Nito are friends and they like to be together at a nice bar in Palermo Hollywood.<br />About at 3 a.m. they start to feel sleepy and want to go home. They want to get home quickly<br />so each of them uses a path that minimizes the distance to his home. However, Charly and<br />Nito also like to walk together while they talk about the &ldquo;good old times&rdquo;, so they want to<br />walk together as much as possible.<br />Charly and Nito live in a city that can be modeled as a set of streets and junctions. Each<br />street connects a pair of distinct junctions and can be walked in both directions. No two streets<br />connect the same pair of junctions. Charly and Nito do not live together, and they do not live<br />at the bar. There is at least one path from the bar to Charly&rsquo;s home; the same occurs with<br />Nito&rsquo;s home.<br />Given information about the streets and junctions in the city, the locations of the bar, Charly&rsquo;s<br />home and Nito&rsquo;s home, you must tell Charly and Nito the maximum distance that they can<br />walk together without forcing them to walk more than the minimum distance from the bar to<br />their respective homes. Charly and Nito also want to know how much each of them will walk<br />alone.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line of<br />each test case contains five integers J, B, C, N and S separated by single spaces. The value<br />J is the number of junctions in the city (3 &le; J &le; 5000); each junction is identified by an<br />integer number between 1 and J. The values B, C and N are the identifiers of the junctions<br />where the bar, Charly&rsquo;s home and Nito&rsquo;s home are located, respectively (1 &le; B, C, N &le; J);<br />these three junction identifiers are different. The value S is the number of streets in the city<br />(2 &le; S &le; 150000). Each of the next S lines contains the description of a street. Each street<br />is described using three integers E1 , E2 and L separated by single spaces, where E1 and E2<br />identify two distinct junctions that are endpoints of the street (1 &le; E1 , E2 &le; J), and L is the<br />length of the street (1 &le; L &le; 10<sup>4</sup> ). You may assume that each street has a different pair of<br />endpoints, and that there exist paths from junction B to junctions C and N . The last line<br />of the input contains the number &minus;1 five times separated by single spaces and should not be<br />processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with three integers T , C and N separated by single<br />spaces, where T is the maximum distance that Charly and Nito can walk together, C is the<br />distance that Charly walks alone, and N is the distance that Nito walks alone.</p>
