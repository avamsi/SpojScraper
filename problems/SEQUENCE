Cryptographic analysis makes extensive use of the frequency with which
letters and letter sequences occur in a language.  If an encrypted
text is known to be in english, for example, a great deal can be
learned from the fact that the letters E, L, N, R, S, and T are the
most common ones used in written english.  Even more can be learned if
common letter pairs, triplets, etc. are known. <P>

For this problem you are to write a program which accepts as input a
text file of unspecified length and performs letter sequence analysis
on the text.  The program will report the five most frequent letter
sequences for each set of sequences from one to five letters.  That is
it will report the individual characters which occur with the five
highest frequencies, the pairs of characters which occur with the five
highest frequencies, and so on up to the letter sequences of five
characters which occur with the five highest frequencies. <P>

The program should consider contiguous sequences of alphabetic
characters only, and case should be ignored (e.g. an `a' is the same
as an `A').  A report should be produced using the format shown in the
example at the end of this problem description.  For each sequence
length from one to five, the report should list the sequences in
descending order of frequency.  If there are several sequences with
the same frequency then all sequences should be listed in alphabetical
order as shown (list all sequences in upper case).  Finally, if there
are less than five distinct frequencies for a particular sequence
length, simply report as many distinct frequency lists as possible. <P>

When a text file containing simply the line ``Peter Piper Picks
Pickles!'' is used as input, the output should appear as shown here: <P>
