<p>A big office uses a cleaning robot to empty the trash can in every cubicle. The surface of<br />each cubicle is a square and the office floor plan is organized as a rectangular matrix of R<br />rows of C cubicles each. The cleaning process begins by the robot entering the floor by a<br />door that accesses the topmost leftmost cubicle, and finishes with the robot exiting using<br />the same door. Both entering and leaving take 26 seconds each. When the cleaning robot<br />is in a cubicle it can emtpy the trash can using 13 seconds. The robot can also move to<br />a cubicle that shares a side with its current location, using 38 seconds. The robot needs<br />to enter in each cubicle at least once to empty its trash can.</p>
<p>The total time the robot takes for the entire process depends on the actual tour through<br />the different cubicles. Among all possible tours, we are interested in those of minimum<br />time.</p>
<p>Given the description of the office, you must indicate the minimum time required for<br />the entire cleaning process (including entering, leaving, emptying the trash can in every<br />cubicle, and moving around). Notice that it is possible that an optimal tour passes<br />through a cubicle several times, but the robot has to take the time to empty the trash<br />can only once.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line contains<br />two integers R and C separated by a single space, representing the number of rows and<br />cubicles per row, respectively (1 &le; R, C &le; 100). The last line of the input contains the<br />number &minus;1 twice separated by a single space and should not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with an integer representing the minimum number<br />of seconds that the robot needs to complete the cleaning process.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
