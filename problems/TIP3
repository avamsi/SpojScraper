<p align="justify">
<p>In number theory, Euler's totient (or PHI function), is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a positive integer N that are relatively prime to this number N.</p>
<p>
That is, if N is a positive integer, then PHI(N) is the number of integers K for which GCD(N, K) = 1 and 1 &#8804; K &#8804; N. We denote GCD the Greatest Common Divisor. For example, we have PHI(9)=6.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, PHI(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There is only one number M.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For the given M, you have to print on a single line the value of N, for which 1 < N < M, PHI(N) is a permutation of N and the ratio N/PHI(N) produces a minimum. If there's several answers output the greatest, or if need, "No solution." without quotes.</br>
Leading zeros are not allowed for integers greater than 0.</p>

<p><b>Explanations :</b>
For the first case, in the range ]1..22[, the lonely number n for witch phi(n) is in permutations(n) is 21, (we have phi(21)=12). So the answer is obviously 21.</br>
For the second case, in the range ]1..222[, there's two numbers n for witch phi(n) is in permutations(n), we have phi(21)=12 and phi(63)=36. But as 63/36 is equal to 21/12, we're taking the greater : 63.</br>
For the third case, in the range ]1..2222[, there's four numbers n for witch phi(n) is in permutations(n), phi(21)=12, phi(63)=36, phi(291)=192 and phi(502)=250. Within those solutions 291/192 is the minimum, we output 291.</p>


<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>If you got TLE, you should consider before <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/TIP2/">TIP2</a>. Enjoy.</br>
Warning : don't try to investigate the input number, <a href="https://www.spoj.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=3388&p=39002&sid=edd39fcdd1d39b9ce68d919f85656c72#p39002">judge</a> is strict and interactive ; test case is randomly changing, staying equivalent in difficulty. Please don't use spurious spaces and end your answer with '\n' ; e.g. "21\n" awaited for the sample.</br>
There is many ways to optimize the solution for this problem, to get AC here, you'll need to find many of them.</br>
Time limit allows python3 solutions.</br>
There is different judges, time is the sum of them.
