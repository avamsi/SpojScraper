<p align="justify">
<p>The Nlogonia Kingdom needs a new king. Differently from other monarchy kingdoms,<br />where the king&rsquo;s choice is hierarchical, at Nlogonia any citizen can apply for the post and the<br />whole population can vote on those who applied. However, with these conditions, a big<br />problem arises: every citizen would probably apply and vote for itself.<br />In order to solve this problem the Nlogonia council decided to split the voting process<br />in two phases. In the first phase, known as constraint phase, every citizen must write two<br />constraints about another two candidates. A constraint can be of one of the following two<br />types: a reliability constraint, which means that the citizen trusts another citizen and wishes<br />that it takes place in the second phase of the voting process; an unreliability constraint, which<br />means that the citizen doesn&rsquo;t trust another one and wishes that he doesn&rsquo;t take place in the<br />second phase of the process. The council decided that at least one of the constraints of every<br />citizen must be satisfied in order to choose the group of candidates that can go forward to the<br />second phase. The citizen cannot give itself a reliability constraint.<br />The second phase of the process is a simple voting process where every citizen<br />chooses between one of the candidates that remained from the first phase.<br />Your job is to determine if it is possible to satisfy at least one of the two constraints of<br />every citizen, even if it means that no candidate remains for the second phase, in this case the<br />council decides who must be the king.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains one integer N<br />representing the number of citizen in the Nlogonia Kingdom (3 &le; N &le; 1000). The candidates are<br />identified by different integer from 0 to N-1. Each of the next N lines describes the two<br />constraints of a citizen, and each one starts with an uppercase letter that is either &lsquo;R&rsquo; or &lsquo;U&rsquo;,<br />where &lsquo;R&rsquo; indicates a reliability constraint and &lsquo;U&rsquo; indicates a unreliability constraint, followed<br />by a integer C (0 &le; C &lt; 1000) representing the candidate that the citizen gave the constraint.<br />The two constraints will be separated by single space.<br />The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test, use the output uppercase &lsquo;Y&rsquo; if it is possible to satisfy at least one<br />constraint for each citizen and &lsquo;N&rsquo; if it is not.</p>
