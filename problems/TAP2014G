On every turn, each of them chooses a different player from the ones who have not been selected yet, and this player is assigned to his/her team. Germ&aacute;n won the coin flip and he gets to choose first on every turn. However, to be gallant, Germ&aacute;n can let Gianina go first on some turns if he wants so.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">For example, if N = 6 there are N/2 = 3 turns.

Every friend of Germ&aacute;n and Gianina has a score that indicates how well they play. If the sum of scores of Germ&aacute;n's team is strictly greater than the sum of scores of Gianina's team, then Germ&aacute;n's team will win the match. If the sum of scores is the same for both teams, the match ends in a draw. Otherwise, Gianina's team will be the winner.</div>

Germ&aacute;n won the initial coin flip so he gets to choose first on every turn. However, to be gallant Germ&aacute;n can let Gianina go first on some turns if he wants so.</p>
<p>For example, if <strong>N = 6</strong> there are <strong>N/2 = 3</strong> turns. Suppose Germ&aacute;n decides to yield his right to choose first on the second and third turns, but not on the first one. In that case, the order of selection of players would be:</p>
