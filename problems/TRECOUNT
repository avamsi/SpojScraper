<p>Our superhero Carry Adder has uncovered the secret method that the evil Head Crash uses to</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
<p>Input will be formatted as follows. Each test case will occur on its own line. Each line will contain</p>
<p>only a single integer, N, the number of nodes. The value of N will be between 1 and 1427, inclusive.</p>
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
<p>Your output is one line per test case, containing only the nine-digit code (note that you must print</p>
<p>leading zeros).</p>
