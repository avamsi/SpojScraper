<p align="justify">
<p>The fact that any positive integer has a representation as the sum of at most four positive squares (i.e. squares of positive integers) is known as Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem. The first published proof of the theorem was given by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1770. Your mission however is not to explain the original proof nor to discover a new proof but to show that the theorem holds for some specific numbers by counting how many such possible representations there are.
For a given positive integer n, you should report the number of all representations of n as the sum of at most four positive squares. The order of addition does not matter, e.g. you should consider 4^2 + 3^2 and 3^2 + 4^2 are the same representation.
<br><br>
For example, let's check the case of 25. This integer has just three representations 1^2+2^2+2^2+4^2, 3^2 + 4^2, and 5^2. Thus you should report 3 in this case. Be careful not to count 4^2 + 3^2 and 3^2 + 4^2 separately. 

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input is composed of at most 255 lines, each containing a single positive integer less than 2^15 , followed
by a line containing a single zero. The last line is not a part of the input data.


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The output should be composed of lines, each containing a single integer. No other characters should
appear in the output. The output integer corresponding to the input integer n is the number of all
representations of n as the sum of at most four positive squares.
