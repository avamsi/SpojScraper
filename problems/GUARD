   <p>The Bluewater Security Company provides guards for clients with valuable
   possessions. Bluewater has found that clients are interested in having
   guards posted where they can see everything that is valuable merely by
   turning their heads, and also like guards to be posted particularly close to
   particularly valuable items. A sample site layout is shown above. Ignore the
   three black dots for now. Various locations are labeled and assigned values.
   For instance location A at coordinates (0,8) is the position of an item with
   value 4. Locations showing a value 0, like G, do not have a valuable item.
   The straight lines indicate corridors. For simplicity, corridors are modeled
   as line segments with 0 width. A guard at an intersection point of several
   corridors can see and therefore guard the items on each of the corridors. If
   Bluewater were contracted to supply 3 guards, they might choose to post them
   at the positions indicated with the small black dots. The guard not at an
   already labeled position is at (15.5, 6). To model the desire for guards to
   be closer to items of higher value, Bluewater calculates the <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">risk</span> to a valuable item to be the value of the
   item times the minimum distance to a guard that can <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">see</span> the item. Even if a guard is close to an
   item that is around a corner, that guard does <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">not</span> affect the risk to the item, since the
   guard cannot see around a corner. In the diagram shown, the risks to the
   items are A: 4x5=20, C: 4x2.5=10, D: 2x0=0, .... The largest risks are
   for H: 50x7.5=375 and I: 50x7.5=375, so the maximum risk to any one item is
   375. With this site layout, no arrangement of 3 guards would provide a lower
   maximum risk, so this arrangement of 3 guards minimizes the maximum risk.
   Bluewater would like to be able to tell any client who requests a particular
   number of guards for a particular site layout, what the minimized maximum
   risk will be.</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input will consist of one to sixteen data
   sets, followed by a line containing only 0. On each line the data will
   consist of blank separated tokens.</p>

   <p>The first line of a dataset contains integers <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">p c g</span>, where <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">p</span> is the number of points specified,
   <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> is the number of corridors, and
   <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span> is the number of guards to be
   placed. Constraints are 1<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt; p</span>

   &lt; 12; 0 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span> &lt; 12; 0 &lt;
   <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span> &lt; 5.  </p>

   <p>Next in the dataset are a total of <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">p</span> groups of four tokens, each consisting of a
   capital letter and three nonnegative integers <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">L</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">x y
   v</span> indicating the point (<span style="font-style: italic;">x</span>,
   <span style="font-style: italic;">y</span>) with label <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">L</span> contains an item with value <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">v</span>. If <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">p</span> is no greater than 6, these groups will all
   be on one line. If <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span> is greater
   than 6, then the seventh and further groups will be on the next line. Labels
   will be consecutive letters starting from A. All the numbers are less than
   1000. Each of the points is unique. A value of 0 for <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">v</span> means there is no item of value there. The
   number of locations with items of value will be at least as large as the

   number of guards. </p>

   <p>The last line of a dataset contains <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">c </span>strings of letters, one for each corridor.
   For each corridor the letters are labels for points along the corridor, in
   order along the line segment from one end to the other, including both
   endpoints, all intersection points with other corridors, and all locations
   on the corridor with a valuable item. Each of the points given in the
   dataset will lie on at least one of the corridors.  </p>


<h3>Output</h3>
<p>There is one line of output for each data set.  If there
   are not enough guards supplied to be able to see all the valuables, the line
   is "too few guards".  Otherwise the line is an unsigned number <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">r</span> rounded to two places beyond the decimal
   point, where r is the minimum value over all placements of <span style=
   "font-style: italic;">g</span> guards of the maximum "risk" to the
   valuables.</p>

   <p>The first example dataset matches the illustration above, and the next
   three examples only vary the number of guards.</p>
