<p align="justify">
<p>The Tyrell corporation uses a state-of-the-art electronic document system
   that controls all aspects of document creation, viewing, editing, and
   distribution. Document security is handled via <dfn>access control
   lists</dfn> (ACLs). An ACL defines a set of entities that have access to the
   document, and for each entity defines the set of rights that it has.
   Entities are denoted by uppercase letters; an entity might be a single
   individual or an entire division. Rights are denoted by lowercase letters;
   examples of rights are <i>a</i> for <i>append</i>, <i>d</i> for
   <i>delete</i>, <i>e</i> for <i>edit</i>, and <i>r</i> for <i>read</i>.</p>

   <p>The ACL for a document is stored along with that document, but there is
   also a separate ACL <dfn>log</dfn> stored on a separate log server. All
   documents start with an empty ACL, which grants no rights to anyone. Every
   time the ACL for a document is changed, a new entry is written to the log.
   An entry is of the form <i>ExR</i>, where <i>E</i> is a nonempty set of
   entities, <i>R</i> is a nonempty set of rights, and <i>x</i> is either "+",
   "&#8211;", or "=". Entry <i>E</i>+<i>R</i> says to grant all the rights
   in <i>R</i> to all the entities in <i>E</i>, entry
   <i>E</i>&#8211;<i>R</i> says to remove all the rights in <i>R</i> from
   all the entities in <i>E</i>, and entry <i>E</i>=<i>R</i> says that all the
   entities in <i>E</i> have exactly the rights in <i>R</i> and no others. An
   entry might be redundant in the sense that it grants an entity a right it
   already has and/or denies an entity a right that it doesn't have. A log is
   simply a list of entries separated by commas, ordered chronologically from
   oldest to most recent. Entries are cumulative, with newer entries taking
   precedence over older entries if there is a conflict.</p>

   <p>Periodically the Tyrell corporation will run a security check by using
   the logs to compute the current ACL for each document and then comparing it
   with the ACL actually stored with the document. A mismatch indicates a
   security breach. Your job is to write a program that, given an ACL log,
   computes the current ACL.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of one or more ACL logs, each
   3&#8211;79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line
   containing only "#" that signals the end of the input. Logs will be in the
   format defined above and will not contain any whitespace.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each log, output a single line containing the log
   number (logs are numbered sequentially starting with one), then a colon,
   then the current ACL in the format shown below. Note that (1) spaces do not
   appear in the output; (2) entities are listed in alphabetical order; (3) the
   rights for an entity are listed in alphabetical order; (4) entities with no
   current rights are not listed (even if they appeared in a log entry), so
   it's possible that an ACL will be empty; and (5) if two or more consecutive
   entities have exactly the same rights, those rights are only output once,
   after the list of entities.</p>
