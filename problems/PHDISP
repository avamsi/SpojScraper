<p align="justify">
<p>One day, mathematician and philosopher were engaged in a heated dispute.<BR><BR>

Philosopher said:<BR>
- Ideal line has only length and no width, therefore, no line can have an area.<BR>
Mathematician replied:<BR>
- That's as it may be, but still you can ll a square with a line in such a way that there will be no gaps.<BR>
And you can't deny that a square has an area, and he grinned.<BR>
But Philosopher still wasn't convinced:<BR>
- Show me this line, then.<BR>
- With pleasure... - responded Mathematician and scribbled some equations on a piece of paper:<BR>
<img src="/content/turbo:img0001.jpg"><BR>
- With t increasing, the point (x, y) will move around the square, forming a line.<BR>
- So what? - asked Philosopher. How is it going to ll the entire square?<BR>
- Indeed, it will, - said Mathematician, - Whichever point inside the square you draw, the line will eventually cross that point.<BR>
- No, - replied Philosopher indignantly, - Anyway, I don't believe. When will the line cross this point? - and he put a thick dot inside the square.<BR>
Give Philosopher an answer. <BR>
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p><i>t</i> &#8211; number of tests [<i>t</i> <= 150], than t test cases follows.<BR>
The first line of each test case contains the coordinates (x0, y0) of the dot center (-1 <= x0, y0 <= 1). The second line contains eps <= 0.0001 - the radius of the dot (the dot is essentially a small circle).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output any value of t in the segment [0, 10^12], which corresponds to the line crossing the dot, or "FAIL", if the line doesn't cross the dot.

<h3>Example</h3>
