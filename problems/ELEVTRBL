<p>You are on your way to your rst job interview as a program tester, and you are already<br />late. The interview is in a skyscraper and you are currently in <br />oor s, where you see an<br />elevator. Upon entering the elvator, you learn that it has only two buttons, marked UP<br />u" and DOWN d". You conclude that the UP-button takes the elevator u <br />floors up<br />(if there aren't enough <br />oors, pressing the UP-botton does nothing, or at least so you<br />assume), whereas the DOWN-button takes you d stories down (or none if there aren't<br />enough). Knowing that the interview is at <br />floor g, and that there are only f <br />floors in<br />the building, you quickly decide to write a program that gives you the amount of button<br />pushes you need to perform. If you simply cannot reach the correct <br />floor, your program<br />halts with the message "use the stairs".<br />Given input f, s, g, u and d (<br />floors, start, goal, up, down), nd the shortest sequence<br />of button presses you must press in order to get from s to g, given a building of floors,<br />or output "use the stairs" if you cannot get from s to g by the given elevator.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input will consist of one line, namely f s g u d, where 1 &lt;= s; g &lt;= f &lt;= 1000000 and<br />0 &lt;= u; d &lt;= 1000000. The <br />floors are one-indexed, i.e. if there are 10 stories, s and g be in<br />[1; 10].</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You must reply with the minimum numbers of pushes you must make in order to get from<br />s to g, or output use the stairs if it is impossible given the conguration of the elvator.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
10 1 10 2 1
<strong>Output:</strong>
