Mr. Bitmann, the coach of the national soccer team of Bitland, is a
perfectionist. He taught  his players optimal tactics and
improved their endurance and shape. So they qualified  for
the soccer woldcup this year.
Due to his perfectionism the coach attaches importance not only
to the performance in the game but also before the game.
 So he told the team captain in what formation the team should assemble before the national anthem is played.
 Since each of the 11 team members has a unique number between 1 and 11
 on his shirt, he can represent the formation as a permutation of  numbers.      
 <p>
 Before the first game the coach told  the captain that the team  
 should  line up  in increasing order (picture (d)). But
 some players forgot the ordering and the orientation of the formation like
 in picture (a). Only player 1 has the right orientation.
 The coach went nearly mad when he saw this desaster!
 How could he solve the problem?

 "Hmmm... I'll let my players dance!". A great idea!
            

He took his notebook and started to create a choreography which leads to   
his expected formation. Due to the fact that no one of the  players took dancing lessons he   
restricts his dance to one basic move: 
One player or more players who stand side by side can turn 180 degrees
 around the center of the move. Picture (b) contains an example: The
 players <pre style="text-align:center;">-11 -10 -9 -2</pre> <p align="justify">(we mark players which stand in the wrong direction with
 a minus) can do one move to <pre style="text-align:center;">2 9 10 11</pre>
<p align="justify">
As perfect as he is he calculated a dance with a minimum number of moves.
It works perfectly and now he's planning to do dancing performances                     
with teams with more than 11 members. So he needs your help
to find optimal dancing moves...

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each testcase starts with the number of team members n (0<=n< 2200).
The next lines represent the formation at the beginning and
the expected formation at the end of the choreography.
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each testcase output m, the minimal number of moves which are necessary
 to reach the expected formation. The next m+1 lines should
 represent one possible scenario of moves.
<h3>Example</h3>
