<p align="justify">
<p>After a failed but interesting DNA project, a lot of dinosaurs spread over the lab devouring<br />most of the staff. Jeff, a scientist that worked in the project, managed to survive by hiding in<br />the southwest corner of the lab. Now that all dinosaurs are asleep, he is going to try to leave.<br />The exit of the lab is located at the northeast corner.<br />Jeff knows that if any of the dinosaurs wakes up, he does not stand a chance, so he needs to<br />minimize the likelihood of that happening. For that, he wants to follow a path that maximizes<br />the minimum distance from him to a dinosaur along the path. The length of the path is of no<br />interest to Jeff.<br />For this problem we consider that Jeff and the dinosaurs are points on the plane, and that Jeff&rsquo;s<br />path is a continuous curve conecting the southwest and northeast corners of the lab. As we<br />mentioned, Jeff wants to maximize the minimum distance between this curve and the position<br />of any dinosaur.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line of each<br />test case contains three integers N , W , and H separated by single spaces. The value N is the<br />number of dinosaurs in the lab (1 &le; N &le; 300). The values W (width) and H (height) are the<br />size of the lab on the x and y coordinates, respectively (2 &le; W, H &le; 10<sup><sub>6</sub></sup> ). This means that<br />the starting position of Jeff is at (0, 0), while the exit of the lab is located at (W, H). Each<br />of the next N lines contains two integers X and Y separated by a single space, representing<br />the coordinates of a different dinosaur (1 &le; X &le; W &minus; 1 and 1 &le; Y &le; H &minus; 1). Note that no<br />dinosaur is located on the border of the lab. You may assume that no two dinosaurs have the<br />same location. The last line of the input contains the number &minus;1 three times separated by<br />single spaces and should not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with the maximum possible distance to the closest<br /> dinosaur. Write the result rounded to the closest number with exactly three decimal places,<br /> using the highest in case of ties, as usual.</p>
