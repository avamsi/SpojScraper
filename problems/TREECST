<p>Moles are tidy and hard-working animals. Our mole likes to 

keep its underground residence in utmost
order, so that everyone living there knows where to find 

things.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the mole connected rooms with tunnels so 

that there is a single unique way to get from
one room to any other room. The distance between two rooms 

is the number of halls passed on the
way from one to the other.</p>
<p>Despite all the effort, some of the mole's guests are 

complaining that it takes too long to walk between
certain pairs of rooms.</p>
<p>The mole decided to reconstruct her residence, closing 

one tunnel and opening a new one, so that the
distance between the farthest two rooms is the smallest 

possible, but so that it is still possible to
reach every room from every other room.</p>
<p>Write a program which determines the distance between 

the farthest two rooms after reconstruction,
which tunnel to close and which to open.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer N (1 &#8804; N &#8804; 300 000), the 

number of rooms. The rooms are numbered
1 to N.</p>
<p>Each of the next N&#8722;1 lines contains two integers, the 

numbers of rooms a tunnel connects.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output on separate lines, in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The distance between the two farthest rooms after 

reconstruction.</li>
<li>A pair of integers representing a previously existing tunnel, 

which should be closed.</li>
<li>A pair of integers, the rooms between which a new tunnel 

should be opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The solution will not necessarily be unique. Output 

any reconstruction plan which achieves the
smallest distance between the farthest two rooms.</p>
