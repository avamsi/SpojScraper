<p>According to Wikipedia, an arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer.<br />On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.<br />Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each case is specified on a single line with three integers (&minus;10, 000 &lt; a1 , a2 , a3 &lt; 10, 000) where a1 , a2 , and a3 are distinct.<br />The last case is followed by a line with three zeros.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, you program must print a single line of the form:<br />XX v<br />where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression. v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />4 7 10<br />2 6 18<br />0 0 0<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong><br />AP 13<br />GP 54</pre>
