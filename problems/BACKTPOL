<p>A simple polygon is a polygon that does not overlap with itself. A diagonal of a simple polygon<br />is a segment within the polygon that connects two non-consecutive vertices. A triangulation<br />of a simple polygon of N edges is the drawing of exactly N &minus; 3 diagonals that do not touch<br />each other anywhere, with the possible exception of their endpoints. A triangulation divides<br />the polygon in exactly N &minus; 2 triangles that do not overlap and only touch each other along<br />their edges.</p>
<p>In this problem, you are given the triangulation of a simple polygon, which means, the set of<br />triangles in which a polygon was divided. From them, you need to reconstruct the original<br />polygon.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line of each<br />test case contains an integer N (3 &le; N &le; 500), the number of edges of the original polygon.<br />Each of the next N &minus; 2 lines describes one triangle in the triangulation of the polygon. Each<br />triangle is given by six integers X1 , Y1 , X2 , Y2 , X3 and Y3 separated by single spaces, where Xi<br />and Yi are the coordinates in the XY plane of the i-th vertex of the triangle (&minus;1000 &le; Xi , Yi &le;<br />1000). The triangles and their vertices are not given in any specific order. The last line of the<br />input contains a single &minus;1 and should not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with 2N integers separated by single spaces. These<br />integers must represent the coordinates in the XY plane of the vertices of the original polygon,<br />in clockwise order. To make the output unique, the first vertex to be listed is the one with the<br />smallest X coordinate, and if there are many of those, the one with the smallest Y coordinate<br />among them.</p>
