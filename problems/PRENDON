<p>The ancient civilization of the Prendonians, who lived in Jutland from 5000 BC to 4500</p>
<p>BC, is well known. A Prendonian name is composed of three non empty words formed by</p>
<p>lowercase letters from a to z: an unique &#64257;rst name, one of their parents&rsquo; &#64257;st name with a</p>
<p>su&#64259;x and the other parent&rsquo;s name with the same su&#64259;x. The unique &#64257;rst name always comes</p>
<p>&#64257;rst, but there is no speci&#64257;c order for the other two.</p>
<p>The su&#64259;x denotes the gender of the bearer of the name, jk for male and gvw for female,</p>
<p>for example, if ric is igo and malte&rsquo;s son, his full name would be ric igojk maltejk, but had</p>
<p>ric been a girl, his name would have been ric igogvw maltegvw.</p>
<p>All the Prendonians were monogamic and faithful to their partners. There are no registers</p>
<p>of male homosexual couples, but it was common for two women to be married, and there has</p>
<p>not been a single case of married siblings in Prendonian history. A couple was not considered</p>

<p>Given N 3 word names, write a program that prints Y ES if they are all valid and part of</p>
<p>a valid Prendonian family tree and everyone is related to everyone else, print N O otherwise.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &#64257;rst line consists of a single integer T (1 &le; T &le; 30), which is the number of test</p>
<p>cases. Each test case begins with a line with only the integer N (1 &le; N &le; 1000), the number</p>
<p>of names, followed by N lines with 3 word (a-z lowercase only, each word not longer than 103</p>
<p>characters), the &#64257;rst word is garanteed to be unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
