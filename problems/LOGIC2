<p>Some day in 2003 in Byteland began calm and quietly as any other day. Some people went to work, some to school, some to store to buy food. Drivers were traditionally stucked in traffic jams, drinking coffee and reading morning newspaper. Suddenly the regularity of this day was disturbed by huge explosion."They blew up the embassy of Bajtocja!!!"  somebody cried. Everybody began to run away in panic. </p>
<p>Police works pretty good in Byteland and first radiocars appeared near the embassy only few seconds after the explosion. All the people near the embassy were detained. Only one of the people is the organizer of the explosion, the others could by just occasional witnesses. It is known, among these M(1<=M<=11) people, N(1<=N<=M) people always lie because they want to make the work of police more difficult, the others always tell the truth.</p>
<p>All these people say P(1<=P<=30) sentences in total.All the useful sentences are in one of the 4 forms below, all the other sentences are useless and you can ignore them.</p>
<div align="justify">
       <ul>
               <li>
               I am guilty.
               <li>
               I am not guilty.
               <li>
               <i>Somebody</i> is guilty.
               <li>
               <i>Somebody</i> is not guilty.
               <li>
               Today is <i>Someday</i>.
               </li>
       </ul>
</div>
<p>Among these sentences, <i>Somebody</i> is a name of one of these M people, and <i>Someday</i> is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday.</p>
