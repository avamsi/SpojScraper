<p>In a badminton tournament, each of <strong>n</strong> players play all the other <strong>n - 1</strong> players. Each game results in either a win, or a loss. Players then write down the names of those whom they defeated(say list 1) and also of those who they(players of list 1) defeated. For example, if <strong>A</strong> beats <strong>B</strong> and <strong>B</strong> beats <strong>C</strong>, then <strong>A</strong> writes the names of both <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider a game between <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>E</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, <strong>G</strong> where <strong>A</strong> defeats <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> and <strong>B</strong> defeats <strong>E</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, <strong>C</strong> defeats <strong>E</strong>. Then <strong>A</strong>'s list will have (<strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>E</strong>, <strong>F</strong>) and will not include <strong>G</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Say <strong>A</strong> defeats <strong>B</strong>, <strong>B</strong> defeats <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C</strong> defeats <strong>D</strong>. <strong>D </strong>is not necessarily present in <strong>A</strong>'s list, a player's list contains players of list1 and players defeated by those in list1(<strong>immediate</strong> win).</p>
<p>In this problem, we represent players by integers from 1 to <strong>n</strong>.(Both inclusive)</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains an integer <strong>t</strong>(number of test cases), each test case starts with an integer <strong>n</strong> followed by&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-size: small;">n<sub>c<sub><sub>2</sub></sub></sub></span></strong>(<strong>i.e n</strong>*(<strong>n</strong> - 1)/2) lines(results of all matches) each containing two integers <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong> seperated by a space which means <strong>a</strong> defeated <strong>b</strong>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print a line for each test case containing two space seperated integers <strong>p</strong>, <strong>q</strong> where <strong>p</strong> is the player with maximum possible number of players in his list and <strong>q</strong> is that number(maximum possible number of players in a list).<br />In case there are many players with maximum number of players in their list, print minimum of such possibilities of <strong>p</strong>.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><strong>t</strong> &lt;= 50, <strong>n</strong> &lt;= 250, 1 &lt;= <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong> &lt;= <strong>n</strong></p>
<h3>Example</h3>
