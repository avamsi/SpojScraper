<p>Caprica is one of the 12 colonial planets, but it was completely destroyed by the cylons, robots made<br />by humans that had rebelled. Before the attack, Doctor Gaius Baltar had the following problem.<br />Caprica has N cities, numbered from 0 to N &minus; 1, and M bidirectional roads connecting them, in<br />a way that exists a path between every pair of cities. Let X and Y be two disjoint and non-empty<br />subsets of this N cities. The problem is to find the smallest path length between any cities x and y<br />where x &isin; X and y &isin; Y . A path length is the sum of the distance of each road in this path.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains four integers N , M , A and B<br />representing respectively the number of cities (2 &le; N &le; 1000), the number of roads (1 &le; M &le; 104 ),<br />the number of cities in X (2 &le; A &le; 1000), and the number of cities in Y (2 &le; B &le; 1000), where<br />A + B &le; N.<br />The second line contains A integers and the third line contains B integers, representing the cities<br />in X and Y respectively. Each of the next M lines describes a road using three integers, u, v, and d,<br />indicating that there is a road between the cities u and v with distance d (1 &le; d &le; 104 ).<br />The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output, in a single line, the integer representing the smallest path length between<br />x and y where x &isin; X and y &isin; Y .</p>
