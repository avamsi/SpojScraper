<p>Everyone knows Sir Jadeja can alone blow the opposition away. Sir has dominated the ICC Rankings as well. One day he was going through his career rating graph on <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/234675.html" target="_blank">Cricinfo.com</a> and noticed the peaks in the graph. He found these graphs interesting and decides to create many hypothetical graphs. In all his graphs, at any time&nbsp; the slope of the graph is either 45<sup>o</sup> (increasing) or -45<sup>o </sup>(decreasing) only and takes non-negative integral values only. Since the graphs are hypothetical he starts the graph at rating 0 and end it at 0 too. In between the end points the total time covered is 2N (horizontal axis) units and there are a total of K peaks. He wants to calculate the total number of different graphs for a given N and K. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7. You too are supposed to be good at Maths, so please help Sir solve the problem.</p>
