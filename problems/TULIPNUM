<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Little Tulip recently learnt &nbsp;about how to &nbsp;write numbers. So she wrote some numbers in a paper in a line.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">But she never wrote a number which is less than the prevous one.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">In short , you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).</div>
<p>Little Tulip recently learnt &nbsp;about how to &nbsp;write numbers. So she wrote some numbers in a paper in a line.</p>
<p>But she never wrote a number which is less than the prevous one.</p>
<p>Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.</p>
<p>In short , you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with an integer T (&le; 15), denoting the number of test cases.</p>
<p>The first line of a case is a blank line. The next line contains two integers N (1 &le; N &le; 10^5), q (1 &le; q &le; 10^5). The next line contains N space separated positive integers forming the array. Each of the next q lines will contain a query which is in the form i j (1 &le; i &le; j &le; N).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query you have to print a line containing number of distinct integers from index i to j.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
