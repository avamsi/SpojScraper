<p>Nikola lives in Bittown and he is in love with his girlfriend Anita from a town called Hextown. Nikola</p>
<p>knows the country map very well, and he found the shortest path between these two towns. He calls</p>
<p>this path lucky path. The map of the country can be described as a collection of towns connected</p>
<p>with bidirectional roads.</p>
<p>One day the president of this country decided that there are going to be some works on the roads. In</p>
<p>order to uphold the traffic in the country, only one road is going to be closed per day.</p>
<p>For each road on the lucky path, Nikola wants to know the length of the shortest path between Anita</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains four integers : n - the number of cities, m - the number of roads</p>
<p>between these towns, a - index of town Bittown where Nikola lives, b - the index of town</p>
<p>Hextown where Anita lives. Towns are indexed with numbers 1, 2,&hellip;, n. Next m lines specify roads :</p>
<p>each line contains three integers : u, v and w - there exist road between towns u and v with length w.</p>
<p>Last line of the input contains number k followed by k numbers a = v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, v<sub>k</sub> = b - the lucky path</p>
<p>that Nikola uses.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For every integer t = 1 &hellip; k - 1, in separate line, print the length of the shortest path between cities a</p>
<p>and b, if the road (v<sub>t</sub>, v<sub>t + 1</sub>) is closed. If there is no such path, output &ldquo;-1&rdquo; without quotes.&nbsp;</p>
