<p align="justify">
<p>John is moving to a different city and he wants to use all his perishable food before doing it,<br />to avoid wasting. Luckily all he has now is eggs, flour, sugar and milk, so he is going to make<br />his famous cakes and give them to his friends as a goodbye gift.<br />John only knows how to make an entire cake and not half a cake, a third of a cake, or any<br />other portion. So, he will buy whatever is needed of each ingredient so that he can make an<br />integer number of cakes and have nothing left. Of course, he wants to spend as little money as<br />possible. You must help John to decide how much he should buy of each ingredient.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br />eight integers E, F , S, M , E' , F' , S' and M' separated by single spaces. Values E and E' are<br />numbers of eggs, F and F' are grams of flour, S and S' are grams of sugar, and M and M' are<br />centiliters of milk. For each ingredient, X is the amount John has (0 &le; X &le; 1000), while X' is<br />the amount needed to make a single cake (1 &le; X &le; 1000). The last line of the input contains<br />the number &minus;1 eight times separated by single spaces and should not be processed as a test<br />case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with four non-negative integers separated by single spaces,<br />representing the amount of each ingredient John needs to buy, in the same order and units as<br />the input.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />2 3 4 5 1 1 1 1<br />3 6 9 0 1 2 3 4<br />-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1<br /><strong>Output:</strong>
