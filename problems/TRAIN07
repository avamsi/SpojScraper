<p>Write a program that, given the description of the network of cities and roads, finds the smallest total cost&nbsp;needed to block the roads so that no training route exists satisfying the above requirements.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers N and M (2 &le; N &le; 1 000, N&minus;1 &le; M &le; 5 000), the number of cities&nbsp;and the total number of roads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the following M lines contains three integers A, B and C (1 &le; A &le; N, 1 &le; B &le; N, 0 &le; C &le; 10 000),&nbsp;describing one road. The numbers A and B are different and they represent the cities directly connected by the&nbsp;road. If C=0, the road is paved; otherwise, the road is unpaved and C represents the cost of blocking it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each city is an endpoint for at most 10 roads. There will never be more than one road directly connecting a&nbsp;single pair of cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output should consist of a single integer, the smallest total cost as described in the problem statement.</p>
