For hundreds of years Fermat's Last Theorem, which stated simply that
for <I>n</I> > 2 there exist no integers <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>
> 1 such that <I>a</I>^<I>n</I> = <I>b</I>^<I>n</I> +
<I>c</I>^<I>n</I>, has remained elusively unproven.  (A recent proof
is believed to be correct, though it is still undergoing scrutiny.)
It <I>is</I> possible, however, to find integers greater than 1 that
satisfy the "perfect cube" equation <I>a</I>^3 = <I>b</I>^3 +
<I>c</I>^3 + <I>d</I>^3 (e.g. a quick calculation will show that the
equation 12^3 = 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 is indeed true).  This problem
requires that you write a program to find all sets of numbers
{<I>a</I>,<I>b</I>,<I>c</I>,<I>d</I>} which satisfy this equation for
<I>a</I> <= 100. <P>

The output should be listed as shown below, one perfect cube per line,
in non-decreasing order of a (i.e. the lines should be sorted by their
<I>a</I> values).  The values of <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I>
should also be listed in non-decreasing order on the line itself.
There do exist several values of <I>a</I> which can be produced from
multiple distinct sets of <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>, and <I>d</I> triples.
In these cases, the triples with the smaller <I>b</I> values should be
listed first.  <P>

Note that the programmer will need to be concerned with an efficient
implementation.  The official time limit for this problem is 2
minutes, and it is indeed possible to write a solution to this
problem which executes in under 2 minutes on a 33 MHz 80386 machine.
Due to the distributed nature of the contest in this region, judges
have been instructed to make the official time limit at their site the
greater of 2 minutes or twice the time taken by the judge's solution
on the machine being used to judge this problem. <P>

The first part of the output is shown here: <P>
