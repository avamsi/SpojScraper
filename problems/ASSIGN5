<p align="justify">
<p>New term is coming.&nbsp; Our monitor <a href="../../../users/cathyyin/">Cathy Yin</a> is going to make necessary preparations.&nbsp; Now she has <em>m</em> jobs to do, and <em>n</em> classmates are going to help her.&nbsp; Each job requires some classmates working on it for certain time, say the <em>i</em>-th classmate must work on the <em>j</em>-th job for <em>A<sub>ij</sub></em> minutes.&nbsp; As an OIer of great responsibility she wishes to finish all jobs as soon as possible.&nbsp; But a classmate can do only one job at a time, and two classmates can <strong>not</strong> do the same job at the same moment.&nbsp; For example, to decorate the classroom, Alpha must work on it for 3 minutes <strong>plus</strong> Beta works on it for 4 minutes, then one possible assignment will be ABABBAB, taking 7 minutes in total.</p>
<p>Now she is going to make a detailed schedule specifying who is doing what at each moment.&nbsp; Jobs are independent, i.e. they may be done in arbitrary order.&nbsp; Also for each job anyone can do it for arbitrarily long, but not longer than the required time <em>A<sub>ij</sub></em>.&nbsp; Anyone can be free at any time.&nbsp; Time for certain classmate doing certain work need <strong>not</strong> be consecutive.</p>
<p>As her friend, you are to help her to work out the schedule minimizing the time needed.&nbsp; (The time of this assignment itself does not count!)</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of the input contains two positive integers <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> (1 &lt;= <em>m</em>, <em>n</em> &lt;= 2000), number of jobs and classmates.</p>
<p><em>m</em> lines follow, each descibing a job.&nbsp; <em>i</em>-th line contains <em>n</em> non-nagative integers (&lt;= 10<sup>6</sup>), where the <em>j</em>-th number is A<sub>ij</sub>, meaning that the <em>j</em>-th classmate has to work on the <em>i</em>-th job for A<sub>ij</sub> minutes as descibed above.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>First line contains single integer T, minimum time needed.&nbsp; Next line contains <em>n</em> non-negative intergers (&lt;= <em>m</em>), giving one possible schedule for the <strong>first</strong> minute, where the <em>i</em>-th number specifying the job for the <em>i</em>-th classmate to do, and 0 denotes that the corresponding classmate is free.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, any one is accepted.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />2 2<br />2 5<br />5 1<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong><br />7<br />1 0</pre>
<h4>Explanation:</h4>
<p>Two jobs are assigned to two classmates, say Lambda and Mu.&nbsp; To tidy up the classroom Lambda needs to work for 2 minutes and Mu 5 minutes; and to move desks for new comers Lambda needs 5 minutes and Mu 1 minute.<br /><br />One optimal schedule is:</p>
