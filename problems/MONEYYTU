<p>It is Taru&rsquo;s dream to study in Yanyang Technological University and Taru must start saving money in order to ensure that he has sufficient funds to take admission. Taru needs to have X amount of dollars at the end of T months. Taru deposits his money in a bank that pays a monthly interest of R% on the balance in his account. But wait, Taru is very superstitious; he deposits money in his account only if the balance in the account is a multiple of 100. If the balance in the account at the beginning of a month is not a multiple of 100 Taru withdraws the minimum offset to make the balance divisible by 100 and donates it to a charitable trust. Example &ndash; If in the beginning of the month Taru has $17823 in his account he will donate $23 and make the balance divisible by 100. You are to calculate the minimum monthly installment which Taru should deposit in the bank in order to get the funds required.</p>
