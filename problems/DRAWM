<p>You are a member of a team that is working in a new wonderful graphics program.<br />Your task is to write a module for drawing skylines of mountains. However, for now the<br />program is in beta version, so each skyline is discretized. This means that your module<br />receives as input a sequence of integers representing heights. Each pair of consecutive<br />heights in the sequence may differ by at most 1 and produces a column of output, each<br />column containing a single character. The particular character to write and its position<br />in the column depend on the pair of heights. When both heights are equal an underscore<br />(&ldquo; &rdquo;) must be printed. If the heigths within the pair increase or decrease, you must write<br />a slash (&ldquo;/&rdquo;) or a backslash (&ldquo;\&rdquo;), respectively. The position of the character in the<br />column is such that the skyline visually respect the given heights.<br />For instance, the sequence of heights (1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0) must produce the skyline shown<br />in the following figure.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">&nbsp; &nbsp; _<br />&nbsp;/\/ \<br />/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \</span></p>
<p>Notice that when the sequence of heights has C + 1 elements, the corresponding skyline<br />has only C columns. Given a sequence of heights, you must draw the skyline according<br />to the rules given above. See the examples for further clarification.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two lines. The first<br />line contains an integer C indicating the number of columns of the skyline (1 &le; C &le; 70).<br />The second line contains C + 1 integers Hi separated by single spaces representing the<br />sequence of heights (0 &le; Hi &le; 30 for 1 &le; i &le; C + 1). You may assume that there exist<br />an height Hi = 0, and that the difference between succesive heights is at most 1 (i.e.<br />|Hi &minus; Hi+1 | &le; 1 for 1 &le; i &le; C). The last line of the input contains a single &minus;1 and should<br />not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output the correponding skyline, followed by a line with exactly three<br />asterisks (&ldquo;***&rdquo;). While writting the skyline, use only regular spaces, newlines, and the<br />three characters mentioned in the statement. Ths skyline must be left aligned and it<br />must contain exactly C columns. There must be no trailing spaces at the end of printed<br />lines, neither empty lines.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />8<br />1 2 3 2 3 3 2 1 0<br />3<br />1 0 0 1<br />-1<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong><br /><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">  &nbsp; _<br />&nbsp;/\/ \<br />/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br /></span>***<br />\_/<br />***</pre>
