<p>Hundreds of years ago Johnny's father had a great kingdom. Before his death he divided his kingdom between his sons (Johnny and Johnny's brother). Johnny's brother took part of the kingdom with a circular shape with radius <strong><em>R</em></strong>.&nbsp; Jonny took part of kingdom of squared shape with side length <strong><em>L</em></strong>. As Johnny was jealous from his brother after his father's death, he decided to extend his kingdom to be a circle such that the corners of the square lies exactly on the border of the circle. A problem might occur that Johnny could steal some land from his brother, and that could wage a huge war between the two brothers. So Johnny decided to convince his brother to build a wall separating between the two kingdoms. The wall should be connecting the two intersection points between the two circles. You are to estimate the length of this wall.</p>

<h2>Input Format&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <strong><em>T</em></strong>, the number of test cases. <strong><em>T</em></strong> test cases follow, the first line of each test case contains 6 floating point numbers; 2 numbers denoting the center of Johnny's brother kingdom, another 2 for the center of Johnny's kingdom, <strong><em>R</em></strong> the radius of Johnny's brother kingdom <strong><em>A</em></strong>, and <strong><em>L</em></strong> the side length of the square of Johnny's kingdom. It&rsquo;s guaranteed that both kingdoms don&rsquo;t share any lands originally. Also after kingdom <strong><em>B</em></strong> is extended, it&rsquo;s guaranteed that the intersection area will not cover Johnny's brother kingdom completely. The absolute value for all decimal numbers will be less than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<h2>Output Format</h2>
<p>There should be <strong><em>T</em></strong> lines, containing the following format.</p>
<p><strong><em>k. S</em></strong></p>
<p>Where <strong><em>k</em></strong> is the test case number (starting at 1), a single period, a single space and <strong><em>S</em></strong> represent a decimal number with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point representing the wall length. If there&rsquo;s no possibility of war, print &ldquo;<strong><em>No problem</em></strong>&rdquo;.</p>
