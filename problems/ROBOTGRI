<p align="justify">
<p>You have recently made a grid traversing robot that can<br /> nd its way from the top left corner of a grid to the<br />bottom right corner. However, you had forgotten all your<br />AI programming skills, so you only programmed your robot<br />to go rightwards and downwards (that's after all where the<br />goal is). You have placed your robot on a grid with some<br />obstacles, and you sit and observe. However, after a while<br />you get tired of observing it getting stuck, and ask yourself<br />\How many paths are there from the start position to the<br />goal position?", and \If there are none, could the robot have<br />made it to the goal if it could walk upwards and leftwards?"<br />So you decide to write a program that, given a grid of<br />size n x n with some obstacles marked on it where the robot<br />cannot walk, counts the dierent ways the robot could go<br />from the top left corner s to the bottom right t, and if none,<br />tests if it were possible if it could walk up and left as well.<br />However, your program does not handle very large numbers, so the answer should be<br />given modulo 2^31 - 1.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>On the rst line is one integer, 1 &lt; n &lt;= 1000. Then follows n lines, each with n characters,<br />where each character is one of '.' and '#', where '.' is to be interpreted as a walkable<br />tile and '#' as a non-walkable tile. There will never be a wall at s, and there will never<br />be a wall at t.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output one line with the number of dierent paths starting in s and ending in t (modulo<br />2^31 - 1) or THE GAME IS A LIE if you cannot go from s to t going only rightwards and<br />downwards but you can if you are allowed to go left and up as well, or INCONCEIVABLE if<br />there simply is no path from s to t.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
5<br />.....<br />#..#.<br />#..#.<br />...#.<br />.....

<strong>Output:</strong>
