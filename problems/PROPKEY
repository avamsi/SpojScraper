Many people think that Tetris was invented by two Russian programmers. But that
is not the whole truth. The idea of the game is very old -- even the Egyptians had
something similar. But they did not use it as a game. Instead, it was used as
a&nbsp;very complicated lock. The lock was made of wood and consisted of a large
number of square fields, laid out in regular rows and columns. Each field was
either completely filled with wood, or empty. The key for this lock was
two-dimensional and it was made by joining square parts of the same size
as the fields of the lock. So they had a 2D lock and 2D key that could be
inserted into the lock from the top. The key was designed so that it was
not possible to move it upwards. It could only fall down and it could
slide sideways -- exactly like in a Tetris game. The only difference is
that the key could not be rotated. Rotation in Tetris is really a Russian
invention.

The entry gate into the Pyramid has such a lock. The ACM archaeologists have
found several keys and one of them belongs to the lock with a very high
probability. Now they need to try them out and find which one to use. Because
it is too time-consuming to try all of them, it is better to begin with those keys that
may be inserted deeper into the lock. Your program should be able to
determine how deep a given key can be inserted into a given lock.

<H3>Input</H3>

<p align=justify>The input consists of <VAR>T</VAR> test cases. The number of them (<VAR>T</VAR>) is given on
the first line of the input file.
Each test case begins with a line containing two integers <VAR>R</VAR> and <VAR>C</VAR>
(<VAR>1 &lt;= R,C &lt;= 100</VAR>) indicating the key size. Then exactly <VAR>R</VAR> rows follow,
each containing <VAR>C</VAR> characters. Each character is either a hash mark
(<CODE>#</CODE>) or a period (<CODE>.</CODE>). A hash mark represents one square field made
of wood; a period is an empty field. The wooden fields are always connected,
i.e. the whole key is made of one piece.
Moreover, the key remains connected even if we cut off arbitrary number of rows
from its top. There is always at least one
non-empty field in the top-most and bottom-most rows and the left-most and
right-most columns.

<p align=justify>After the key description, there is a line containing two integers <VAR>D</VAR> and <VAR>W</VAR>
(<VAR>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 10000</VAR>,
<VAR>1 &lt;= W &lt;= 1000</VAR>). The number <VAR>W</VAR> is the lock width,
and <VAR>D</VAR> is its
depth. The next <VAR>D</VAR> lines contain <VAR>W</VAR> characters each. The character may be
either a hash mark (representing the wood) or a period (the free space).


<H3>Output</H3>

<p align=justify>Your program should print one line of output for each test case. The line
should contain the statement
"<CODE>The key falls to depth <VAR>X</VAR>.</CODE>". Replace <VAR>X</VAR>
with the maximum depth to which the key can be inserted by moving it down 
and sliding it to the left or right only. The depth is measured as the distance
between the bottom side of the key and the top side of the lock. If it is
possible to move the key through the whole lock and take it away at the bottom
side, output the sentence "<CODE>The key can fall through.</CODE>".
