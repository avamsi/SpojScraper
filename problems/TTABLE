<p>
	You are the owner of a railway system between n cities, numbered by integers 
	from 1 to n. Each train travels from the start station to the end station 
	according to a very specific timetable (always on time), not stopping anywhere 
	between. On each station a departure timetable is available. Unfortunately each 
	timetable contains only direct connections. A passenger that wants to travel 
	from city p to city q is not limited to direct connections however - he or she 
	can change trains. Each change takes zero time, but a passenger cannot change 
	from one train to the other if it departs before the first one arrives. People 
	would like to have a timetable of all optimal connections. A connection 
	departing from city p at A o'clock and arriving in city q at B o'clock is 
	called optimal if there is no connection that begins in p not sooner than at A, 
	ends in q not later than at B, and has strictly shorter travel time than the considered connection. We are only interested in connections that 
	can be completed during same day.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li>
		reads the number n and departure timetable for each of n cities from the 
		standard input,
		<li>
		creates a timetable of optimal connections from city 1 to city n,
		<li>
			writes the answer to the standard output.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
	The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test 
	cases follow.
</p>
<p>
	For each test case the first line of the input contains an integer n (2 <= n 
	<= 100000). The following lines contain n timetables for cities 1, 2, ..., n 
	respectively.
</p>
<p>
	The first line of the timetable description contains only one integer m. Each 
	of the following m lines corresponds to one position in the timetable and 
	contains: departure time A, arrival time B (A < B) and destination city 
	number t (1 <= t <= n) separated by single spaces. Departure time A and 
	arrival time B are written in format hh : mm, where hh are two digits 
	representing full hours (00 <= hh <= 23) and mm are two digits 
	representing minutes (00 <= mm <= 59). Positions in the timetable are 
	given in non-decreasing order according to the departure times. The number of 
	all positions in all timetables does not exceed 1000000.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
	For each test case the first line of the output contains an integer r - the 
	number of positions in the timetable being the solution. Each of the following 
	r lines contains a departure time A and an arrival time B separated by single 
	space. The time format should be like in the input and positions in the 
	timetable should be ordered increasingly according to the departure times. If 
	there is more then one optimal connection with the same departure and arrival 
	time, your program should output just one.
</p>
