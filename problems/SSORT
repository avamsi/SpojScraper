<p align="justify">
<p>Your younger brother has an assignment and needs some help. His teacher gave him a sequence of numbers to be sorted in ascending order. During the sorting process, the places of two numbers can be interchanged. Each interchange has a cost, which is the sum of the two numbers involved.
<p>You must write a program that determines the minimal cost to sort the sequence of numbers.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (n>1), representing the number of items to be sorted. The second line contains n different integers (each positive and less than 1000), which are the numbers to be sorted.
<p>The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, the output is a single line containing the test case number and the minimal cost of sorting the numbers in the test case. 
<p>Place a blank line after the output of each test case.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
