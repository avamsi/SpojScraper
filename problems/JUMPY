<p>A <em>cycle</em> is a connected undirected graph with <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span> vertices of degree 2. (Special cases: The cycle for <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em> = 2</span> is a graph with two vertices and two parallel edges between them. For <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em> = 1</span> the cycle is a graph with a single vertex and a loop. In all cases, you can imagine the cycle as a circle passing through <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span> locations.)</p>
<p>The <em>distance</em> <span class="texhtml"><em>d</em></span> of two vertices is the number of edges on the shortest path that connects them.</p>
<p>A <em>labelling</em> of a cycle is a function <span class="texhtml"><em>f</em></span> that assigns a positive integer to each of its vertices.</p>
<p>Given a labelling, we may pick a starting vertex and direction  along the cycle and write down the labels in the order in which we  encounter them. The <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span>-tuple obtained in this way is called a <em>label list</em>.</p>
<p>There may be multiple label lists corresponding to a single  labelling. For example, the label lists (3,8,25,14,17) and  (25,8,3,17,14) may come from the same labelling.</p>
<p>A labelling is called <em>jumpy</em> if it has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li> No two labels are equal. </li>
<li> For each pair of distinct vertices <span class="texhtml"><em>u</em>,<em>v</em></span> the greatest common divisor of <span class="texhtml"><em>f</em>(<em>u</em>)</span> and <span class="texhtml"><em>f</em>(<em>v</em>)</span> is at most <span class="texhtml"><em>d</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>v</em>)</span>. </li>
</ul>
<p>(In other words, neighboring vertices must have relatively prime  labels, vertices at distance 2 may only have 2 as the common divisor of  their labels, etc.)</p>
<p>For example, a cycle with the label list (3,8,25,14,17) is a jumpy cycle.</p>
<p>The <em>upper bound</em> of a labelling is the largest integer it uses.</p>
<p>Given two distinct label lists of a given cycle, look at the  first position where they differ. The one with the smaller value on this  position is <em>lexicographically smaller</em>.</p>
<h2><span id="Task" class="mw-headline">Task</span></h2>
<p>Given is the number of vertices <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span>. Find a jumpy labelling of a cycle with <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span> vertices with the smallest possible upper bound. If there are multiple  such labellings, pick the one that can produce the lexicographically  smallest label list.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Ignore the input.The file's empty, anyway.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span> from 1 to 20 output a single line with a sequence of <span class="texhtml"><em>n</em></span> positive integers: the lexicographically smallest label list that  determines a jumpy labelling with the smallest possible upper bound. Separate the integers by single spaces. (Do not print a space after the  last integer on a line.)</p>
