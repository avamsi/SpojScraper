<pre>
Mirko works on a pig farm that consists of M  locked pig-houses 
and Mirko  can't unlock any pig-house because he doesn't have the keys. 
Customers come to the farm one after another. Each of them has keys 
to some pig-houses and wants to buy a certain number of pigs. 
All data concerning customers planning to visit the farm on that 
particular day are available to Mirko early in the morning so that 
he can make a sales-plan in order to maximize the number of pigs sold. 
More precisely, the procedure is as following: the customer arives, 
opens all pig-houses to which he has the key, Mirko sells a certain number 
of pigs from all the unlocked pig-houses to him, and, if Mirko wants, 
he can redistribute the remaining pigs across the unlocked pig-houses. 
An unlimited number of pigs can be placed in every pig-house. 
Write a program that will find the maximum number of pigs that he can 
sell on that day
</pre>
<h3>Input</h3>
<pre>
The first line of input file contains two integers M and N, 1 &#8804; M &#8804; 1000,
1 &#8804; N &#8804; 100, number of pig-houses and  number of customers. Pig 
houses are numbered from 1 to M and customers are numbered 
from 1 to N. 
The next line contains M integeres, for each pig-house initial number
of pigs. The number of pigs in each pig-house is greater or equal to 
0 and less or equal to 1000. 
The next N lines contains records about the customers in the following 
form ( record about the i-th customer is written in the (i+2)-th line): 
A K1 K2 ... KA B 
It means that this customer has key to the pig-houses marked with 
the numbers K1, K2, ..., KA 
(sorted nondecreasingly ) and that he wants to buy B pigs. Numbers 
A and B can be equal to 0. 
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre>
The first and only line of the output file should contain the number of 
sold pigs.
