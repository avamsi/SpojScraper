<h3>
<p><span>1 Note that the scoring of Go boards described here does not correspond exactly to the real game of Go: we make the simplifying assumptions that all &ldquo;disputes&rdquo; have been settled so that any territories surrounded by stones of both colors are considered neutral, and that all groups on the board are considered &ldquo;alive.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div><span style="font-weight: normal;">Figure 1: Diagram of a 9 &times; 9 Go board. Unfilled lattice points belonging to black&rsquo;s territory are marked with B, and unfilled lattice points belonging to white&rsquo;s territory are marked with W. Neutral unfilled lattice points are unmarked. In the game above, white wins by 21 &minus; 3 = 18.</span></div>

</h3>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The input test file will contain multiple cases, each consisting of three lines. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers, n (where 1 &le; n &le; 19), b, and w (where b &ge; 0,w &ge; 0 and 1 &le; b + w &le; n2). Here, n denotes the size of the board, b is the number of black pieces placed, and w is the number of white pieces placed. The second line of each test case contains b pairs of integers r1 c1 . . . rb cb (where 1 &le; ri , ci &le; n) indicating the positions of the b black stones. The third line of each test case contains w pairs of integers r'1 c'1 . . . r'w c'w (where&nbsp;1 &le; r'i , c'i &le; n) indicating the positions of the w white stones. No two stones will be located at the same lattice point. Input is terminated by a single line containing only the number 0; do not process this line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print either &ldquo;White wins by &rdquo;, &ldquo;Black wins by &rdquo;, or &ldquo;Draw&rdquo;.</p>
