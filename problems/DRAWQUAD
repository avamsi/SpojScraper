<p align="justify">
<p>A quadrilateral consists of 4 points A, B, C and D in the plane, together with the<br />segments AB, BC, CD and DA. Points are called vertices, while segments are called<br />sides. The quadrilateral is simple if opposite sides (i.e., sides that do not share a vertex)<br />do not intersect. Notice that it is possible to have a simple quadrilateral that looks like<br />a triangle, with exactly 3 collinear vertices.<br />Demetrio has just drawn N points on the wall of his room. He planned to draw a<br />simple quadrilateral having 4 of these points as vertices, and then paint it with blue ink.<br />Demetrio is going to buy the ink right now, but he has not chosen the 4 points yet. Can<br />you tell him the maximum area a simple quadrilateral drawn on his wall can have? In<br />this way Demetrio will be sure he will not run out of blue ink before the work is done.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains an integer N<br />indicating the number of points drawn on the wall (4 &le; N &le; 1000). Each of the next N<br />lines describes a different point of the set using two integers X and Y (&minus;10<sup>7</sup> &le; X, Y &le;<br />10<sup>7</sup> ); these values represent the coordinates of the point in the XY plane. You may<br />assume that within each test case no two points have the same location, neither are all<br />collinear. The end of input is indicated with a line containing a single &minus;1.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with a single decimal number representing the<br />maximum area of a simple quadrilateral having as vertices 4 different points of the input<br />set. Round the result to the closest rational number with one decimal place. In case of<br />ties, round up. Always use exactly one digit after the decimal point, even if it means<br />finishing with a zero.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<strong>Output:</strong> <br />12000.0<br />5000.5</pre>
