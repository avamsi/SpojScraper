<p align="justify">
<p>The Factory of Computer Enhaced Numbers (FCEN) has asked its Development Comitee (DC)<br />to come up with a way to handle numbers written in base 17.<br />As everybody knows, base 17 is very important for many scientific applications, as well as for<br />engineering and other practical uses. Numbers in base 17 can be tough, but are kind and soft<br />if treated appropiately.<br />Numbers in base 17 are written by using a set of 17 characters: digits 0 to 9 with their usual<br />values, and uppercase letters A to G that have values from 10 to 16, respectively.<br />Base 17, probably because its basement on a prime number, does not require numbers to start<br />with a non-zero digit, so each number has many representations. For instance, the decimal<br />number 117 can be written as 6F , but also as 06F or even 00000006F .<br />Because of this leading-zeroes thing, heptadecimal numbers are hard to compare. As a member<br />of the FCEN-DC, you were asked to write a program that helps in this difficult and challenging<br />task.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br />two non-empty strings of at most 10<sup>5</sup> heptadecimal digits, separated by a single space. The last<br />line of the input contains two asterisks separated by a single space and should not be processed<br />as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with the sign &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; if the first heptadecimal number is<br />smaller than the second one, the sign &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; if the first heptadecimal number is greater than the<br />second one, or the sign &ldquo;=&rdquo; if both heptadecimal numbers are equal.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br /><br />006F B3B<br />0000 0<br />* *<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong>
