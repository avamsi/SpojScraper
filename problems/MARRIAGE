<p>The practice of polygamy is said to have origanted in the Salt Lake City where gender is not an important constraint. In order to obtain a clear count of marriages, each unmarried person living in the city is assigned a unique number. Some believe that love marraiges results in happiness while the rest believe in arranged marriages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatsoever, its the parents who choose their heir's fiances/fiancees. Once their parents take a decision, their marriage is bound to happen in the near future. But recent studies on this city say that,<br /><br />1) A marriage between two persons having a difference of belief, results in a divorce.<br /><br />2) In order to avoid this from happening, some people often change their belief on the day of their marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is sad to note that, both these scenarios results in a death of one of their well-wishers. Given the information about each unmarried person in the city and their fiances/fiancees, help them so that there is minimum number of deaths.<br /><br /><strong>Input:</strong><br /><br />The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.<br /><br />T test cases follow:<br /><br />The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and M.<br />N : Number of unmarried persons.<br />M : Number of pairs for which their marriage has been fixed.<br /><br />M lines follow:<br /><br />Each of the M lines contains two integers : i &amp; j<br /><br />In the following N lines,the belief of each unmarried person is listed, either "Love" or "Arranged" . ( quotes for claification ).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Output:</strong><br /><br />For each test case, print a single line: "Number of Deaths"(quotes for qualification), followed by a colon(:) &amp; a space, and then a single integer containg the minimum number of deaths. Refer the sample output for clarification.<br /><br /><strong>Constraints:</strong><br /><br />1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100<br />1 &lt;= N &lt;= 140<br />1 &lt;=M &lt;=10000<br />1 &lt;= i &lt;= N<br />1 &lt;= j &lt;= N<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Input:</strong><br /><br />1<br />3 2<br />1 2<br />2 3<br />Love<br />Arranged<br />Love<br /><br /><strong>Output:</strong><br /><br />Number of Deaths: 1</p>
