Filled with elation I showed the program to Rohil. Rohil being someone who likes to do stuff off the league was not impressed and gave me the following variation of the problem help me to solve the problem:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">You have to find the number of permutations of length N(1&lt;=N&lt;=12) such that at whenever an alphabet say($) appears in the permutation all the alphabets smaller than $ should have appeared before it at least once. An alphabet is smaller than another if it appears before the other in the English alphabet. &lsquo;a&rsquo; being the smallest and &lsquo;z&rsquo; being the largest. For example when N=2 then aa,ab are the only valid permutations and ba,bb is invalid since in ba all the alphabets smaller than b have not appeared at least once before it. See example for further clarification.</div>
