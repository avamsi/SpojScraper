A chemical company has an unusual shortest path problem.   
There  are N  depots  (vertices) where  chemicals  can  be  stored.  
There  are M  individual  shipping methods (edges) connecting pairs 
of depots.   Each  individual shipping method has a cost.    In  
the usual problem,  the company would  need  to  find  a way  to  route  
a  single  shipment  from  the  first  depot  (0)  to  the  last  (N  -  1).
That's easy.  The problem they have seems harder.  They have to ship 
two chemicals from the first depot (0) to the last (N - 1). The chemicals
are dangerous and cannot safely be placed together.  The regulations say
the company cannot use  the same shipping method  for both chemicals. 
Further,  the company cannot place the two chemicals in same depot 
(for any length of time) without special storage handling --- available only at
the  first  and last  depots.   </p>
<p>
To  begin,  they  need  to  know  if  it's  possible  to  ship  both  
chemicals  under  these constraints.   Next,  they  need to  find  the  
least  cost  of  shipping  both chemicals  from  first  depot to  the  
last depot.  In brief,  they need  two completely separate paths  
(from  the  first depot  to  the  last) where  the overall
cost of both is minimal. 
Your  program must  simply  determine  the minimum  cost  or,  if  it's  
not  possible,  conclusively  state  that  the
shipment cannot be made. </p>

<p>The  input will  consist  of multiple  cases.   The  first  line  of  
each  input will  contain N  and M where N  is  the number of depots 
and M is the number of individual shipping methods.  You may assume 
that N is less than 20 and  that  M  is  less  than  200.    
The  next  M  lines  will  contain  three  values,  i,  j,  and  v.    
Each  line corresponds a single, unique shipping method.  The values i 
and j are the indices of two depots, and v is the cost of 
getting from i to j.  
Note that these shipping methods are directed.  If something can 
be shipped from i to j with cost 10, that says nothing about shipping 
from j to i.  Also, there may be more than one way to ship between 
any pair of depots, and that may be important here. 
</p>
<p>A line containing two zeroes signals the end of data and should not 
be processed.   </p>
