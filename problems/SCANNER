A body scanner works by scanning a succession of horizontal slices through
the body; the slices are imaged one at a time. The image slices can be
reassembled to form a three dimensional model of the object. Write a
program to construct a two dimensional image slice using data captured
during the scan.

<P>
The scanner consists of four arrays of sensors arranged around
a 
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">10Ã—15</SPAN> matrix. Array 1 consists of 10 sensors pointing to the right,
array 2 has 24 sensors pointing diagonally to the top right, array 3
has 15 sensors pointing to the top and array 4 has 24 sensors pointing
to the top left. Each sensor records the thickness of that portion of the
object directly in front of that sensor.
<P>
Readings from the arrays of sensors are recorded in counterclockwise
order. Within an array of sensors, data are also recorded counterclockwise.
A complete scan consists of 73 readings.
<P>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input file begins with a line with an integer indicating the number
of image slices to follow. For each image slice, there are separate lines
with 10, 24, 15, and 24 integers representing sensor data from sensor
arrays 1 through 4 respectively. The order of the readings is indicated
in the diagram. You can assume that there exist at least one image for the given sensor data.
<p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each slice, your program should print 10 lines of 15 cells. To
indicate that the cell represents a part of the object, print a hash
character (<TT>#</TT>) for the cell; to indicate that the cell is not a part of
the object, print a period (<TT>.</TT>). Between successive output image slices,
print a blank line. 

<P>
It is possible for the result of a scan to be ambiguous, in that
case you can print any solution.
