<p>
	Mirek has a favourite way from home to the university that he traverses every 
	working day. The route consists of sections and each section is a straight 
	segment 10 meters long. Each section is either a straight ahead extension of 
	the previous section or it is perpendicular to the previous section. After 
	traversing each section Mirek takes a small break to admire the beauty of the 
	nature. During his walk he never visits the same place twice.
</p>

<p>
	Yesterday Mirek stayed up long in the night at the party and today he got up 
	late from bed. He knows that he will miss the first lecture unless he changes 
	his usual route. He plans to make one shortcut but he wants the shortcut to be 
	as short as possible (well, we can tell you in secret that he doesn't want to 
	be on time, he just wants to calm his conscience). The shortcut must be either 
	a horizontal or vertical segment connecting two break points of Mirek's route.
</p>
<P>Please help Mirek find the shortest shortcut.
</P>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Write a program that:</p>
<div align="justify">
	<ul>
		<li>
		reads Mirek's route,
		<li>
		computes the shortest shortcut on the route,
		<li>
			writes the result.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
	The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test 
	cases follow.
</p>
<p>
	For each test case, the first line of the input contains one integer n (3 &lt;= 
	n &lt;= 250 000) being the number of sections of the route. The second line of 
	the input contains a sequence of n characters N, E, S or W with no spaces in 
	between. Each character is a description of one section of the route. Character 
	N, E, S or W means that Mirek walks 10 meters north, east, south or west 
	respectively. You may assume that at least one shortcut exists for the given 
	route.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
	The first and only line of the output contains integers l, b, e and character d 
	separated by single spaces. Integer l is the length of the shortest shortcut 
	(measured in 10 m segments). Integers b and e are the numbers of break points 
	where the shortcut begins and ends respectively (we number break points with 
	consecutive integers from 0 for Mirek's home to n for the university). 
	Character d is the direction of the shortcut. If more than one shortcut of the 
	minimal length exists you should output the one that begins earliest on the 
	route. If more than one shortcut of the minimal length begins at the same break 
	point you should output the one that ends furthest on the route.
