<p> 
The International Olympiad in Informatics is coming and the leaders of the Vietnamese Team have to choose the best contestants all over the country. Fortunately, the leaders could choose the members of the team among N very good contestants, numbered from 1 to N (3 &#8804; N &#8804; 100000). In order to select the best contestants the leaders organized three competitions. Each of the N contestants took part in all three competitions and there were no two contestants with equal results on any of the competitions. We say that contestant &#1040; is better than another contestant &#1042; when &#1040; is ranked before &#1042; in all of the competitions. A contestant A is said to be excellent if no other contestant is better than A. The leaders of the Vietnamese Team would like to know the number of excellent contestants.
