<p>When dealing with a long task, computers often provide a progress indicator to help users<br />estimate how much longer they will have to wait. This is especially useful when copying a large<br />number of data files from one drive to another.<br />In the Institute of Computer Power Control (ICPC) are very concerned about their brand new<br />file copier, which they think will change forever the way people copy files. While this is a great<br />accomplishment for the engineers in ICPC, the lack of a progress indicator is threatening the<br />future of the project and the well being of most computer users around the world!<br />The Supremum Principal Director Manager of ICPC has called you personally to ensure you<br />are up for the task. The interface provided by the developing team of the file copier only gives<br />two integers M and N . M is the number of files that have already been copied, and N is<br />the total number of files to be copied. Using this information, you must write a module that<br />displays the progress indicator.<br />The indicator must be drawn as a string of exactly 20 characters. The first K of them must<br />be asterisks (&ldquo;*&rdquo;) and the rest must be hyphens (&ldquo;-&rdquo;). The number K must be chosen in such<br />a way that K/20 correctly approximates M/N ; this means that the distance between the two<br />mentioned fractions is minimum. If there is more than one possible value for K, the greatest<br />one must be chosen.<br />Also, for more precision, a number P without leading zeroes and followed by a percentage<br />sign (&ldquo;%&rdquo;) must be written on top of the described indicator. Since the goal is to represent<br />the finished percentage, the number P must be such that P/100 correctly approximates M/N ,<br />with the same policy as before. The finished percentage must be centered on top of the display.<br />This means that if possible, the same number of display characters (&ldquo;*&rdquo; or &ldquo;-&rdquo;) must be seen<br />to the left and to the right of the percentage; if this is not possible, exactly one extra character<br />must be seen to the left.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br />two integers M and N as explained above (0 &le; M &le; N &le; 10<sup>9</sup> and N &ne; 0). These values are<br />separated by a single space. The last line of the input contains the number &minus;1 twice separated<br />by a single space and should not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with exactly 20 characters representing the mentioned<br />display.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
