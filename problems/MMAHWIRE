<pre>
There is a rectangular area containing n Ã— m cells. Two cells are marked
with &#8220;2&#8221;, and another two with &#8220;3&#8221;. Some cells are occupied by obstacles. 
You should connect the two &#8220;2&#8221;s and also the two &#8220;3&#8221;s with non-intersecting
lines. Lines can run only vertically or horizontally connecting centers
of cells without obstacles.

Lines cannot run on a cell with an obstacle. Only one line can run on
a cell at most once. Hence, a line cannot intersect with the other line, 
nor with itself. Under these constraints, the total length of the two
lines should be minimized. The length of a line is defined as the
number of cell borders it passes. In particular, a line connecting cells
sharing their border has length 1.

Fig. 1(a) shows an example setting. Fig. 1(b) shows two lines satisfying the
constraints above with minimum total length 18.

<h3>Input </h3>
<pre>
The input consists of multiple datasets, each in the following format.

    n	m
    row1
    &#8230;
    rown

n is the number of rows which satisfies 2 &#8804; n &#8804; 9. m is the number of columns
which satisfies 2 &#8804; m &#8804; 9. Each rowi is a sequence of m digits separated by
a space. The digits mean the following.

    0: Empty

    1: Occupied by an obstacle

    2: Marked with &#8220;2&#8221;

    3: Marked with &#8220;3&#8221;

The end of the input is indicated with a line containing two zeros separated
by a space.

<h3>Output</h3>
<pre>
For each dataset, one line containing the minimum total length of the two
lines should be output. If there is no pair of lines satisfying the requirement,
answer &#8220;0&#8221; instead.
