<p>In digital recording, sound is described by a sequence of numbers representing the air pressure, measured at a rapid rate with a fixed time interval between successive measurements. Each value in the sequence is called a sample. An important step in many voice-processing tasks is breaking the recorded sound into chunks of non-silence separated by silence. To avoid accidentally breaking the recording into too few or too many pieces, the silence is often defined as a sequence of m samples where the difference between the lowest and the highest value does not exceed a certain treshold c. Write a program to detect silence in a given recording of n samples according to the given parameter values m and c.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the file contains three integers: n (1 &le; n &le; 1,000,000), the number of samples in the recording; m (1 &le; m &le; 10,000), the required length of the silence; and c (0 &le; c &le; 10,000), the maximal noise level allowed within silence. The second line of the file contains n integers ai (0 &le; ai &le; 1,000,000 for 1 &le; i &le; n), separated by single spaces: the samples in the recording.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The file should list all values of i such that max(a[i . . . i + m &minus; 1]) &minus; min(a[i . . . i + m &minus; 1]) &le; c. The values should be listed in increasing order, each on a separate line. If there is no silence in the input file, write NONE on the first and only line of the output file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br />7 2 0<br />0 1 1 2 3 2 2<br /><strong>Output:</strong>
2<br />6</pre>
