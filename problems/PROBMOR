<p>Balin, in his last days, needed to put more workers on the tunnels of Moria to build a<br />lot of shelters to his people and to discovery the depths of that land. However, he didn't know<br />where to put a collection point in order to take all the rocks in the way and bring all of them<br />outside of Moria. The only thing he knew was this collection point needed to be fix in a<br />junction point that connects two independent parts. If there's no point with this feature, any<br />junction point, that's not the source one, can be used.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test is given by a line with two integers<br />X &#57502;0&#57476; X &le;100&#57503; and Y &#57502;Y &#57477;0&#57503; . The first one is the number of points and the second, the<br />number of tunnels. Then, the next Y lines are followed by three integers: A&#57502; 0&#57476; A&le;100&#57503; ,<br />B &#57502;0&#57476;B&le;100&#57503; e C &#57502;C&#57477;0&#57503; , which means, there's a link between A and B with a<br />capacity C of workers that can walk through there. After that, there's a line with only one<br />integer which is the start point, in the other words, the point where the workers are divided.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, display it's case number followed by a blank line. In the next line<br />display the number Z of points that can be used as a collection point and, in the next Z<br />lines shows in decreasing order the maximum number of workers that can be used.<br />Each test case is separated by a blank line as the sample output.</p>
