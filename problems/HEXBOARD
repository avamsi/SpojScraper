<p align="justify">
<p>Square boards (as the chessboard) are really common among games and luckily, they are easy<br />to draw with the help of a ruler. However, there exist other games that requiere hexagonal<br />boards, that are much harder to draw by hand.<br />The Institute for Client Permanent Comfort (ICPC) of a famous board game factory has decided<br />to provide their customers with an automated program to build hexagonal boards for several<br />games. The size of an hexagonal board is determined by a single integer N that indicates how<br />many cells there are in each of the 6 sides of the board. For example, a board of size N = 2<br />should look as follows when drawn by the program.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">_<br />&nbsp;_/ \_<br />/ \_/ \<br />\_/ \_/<br />/ \_/ \<br />\_/ \_/<br />&nbsp; \_/</span><br />Your task is to help ICPC in making the program.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br />an integer N representing the size of the board (1 &le; N &le; 20). The last line of the input<br />contains a single &minus;1 and should not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output the hexagonal board of the required size, and a line with exactly<br />three asterisks. You have to follow the sample input and output, as well as the example given<br />above. Use only regular spaces, underscores (&ldquo; &rdquo;), slashes (&ldquo;/&rdquo;) and backslashes (&ldquo;\&rdquo;). There<br />must be no trailing spaces at the end of printed lines, neither empty lines.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
